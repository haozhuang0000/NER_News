        "Content": "The lesson from tech company earnings so far this year is that selling the infrastructure needed to build artificial intelligence services remains far more lucrative than selling the AI services themselves. Cloud computing divisions at Alphabet and Microsoft surpassed results in other parts of the business. Amazon makes it a hat-trick. \nAmazon Web Services, the world’s largest cloud computing business, now has a $100bn annual run rate. In the past quarter it accounted for 17 per cent of total revenue but more than 61 per cent of total operating income. This performance drove overall profit at the company. \nDuring the pandemic, Amazon’s huge expansion of warehouses, delivery infrastructure and headcount lifted operating expenses sharply just as revenue growth dimmed. Free cash flow was negative in 2021 and 2022. In response, it increased its debt and tightened up costs. Those moves are now paying off. In the quarter, the Seattle-based ecommerce and cloud company’s operating income and net income tripled. Trailing 12-month free cash flow topped $50bn. \nThe unanswered question is whether Amazon is on the cusp of another vast spending plan. It says that it plans to pay down debt and increase capital investment this year. But in a call with analysts, chief executive Andy Jassy was careful not to be drawn on questions of capital investment intensity and the long-term impact on profits. He may have been wary of reproducing the sort of downbeat share price reaction that Meta’s spending plans received last week.\nCapital expenditure will rise this year. Amazon is pouring more money into data centres. But it is not clear how much it wants to spend on its own AI tools. It has positioned itself as a platform for multiple AI models but is also offering its own generative AI services to enterprise customers. It has expanded access to Q, a chatbot designed to act as an AWS assistant. At $20 per user a month this is cheaper than Microsoft’s Copilot or Google’s Duet AI. But Amazon offered little guidance about future revenue streams.\nThe second lingering question is how long it will be before Amazon joins Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Apple is paying a dividend. Those companies use the payments to prove they have the near-term interests of shareholders at heart even as they accelerate long-term spending plans. At Amazon, however, the resurgence of free cash flow is still fresh. Dividend payments may not be on the cards for 2024.\nelaine.moore@ft.com",

        "Author": "Steve Johnson",
        "Content": "US politicians are making better risk-adjusted returns than those chalked up by the public at large, according to analysis of two partisan exchange traded funds that demonstrates their wildly different portfolios.\nThe findings might also reignite the debate over whether members of Congress should be able to make active stock trading decisions, given their potential access to confidential tradeable information.\nSubversive Capital Advisor launched ETFs tracking the investment holdings of Democrat politicians (NANC) and their Republican rivals (KRUZ) in February last year.\nKRUZ is a reference to Republican Senator Ted Cruz while NANC alludes to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic former Speaker of the House of Representatives, whose husband, Paul’s, trading has attracted widespread attention.\nThe ETFs mimic the trades of members of Congress, who are mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (Stock) to disclose any trades worth more than $1,000 made by themselves or their spouses within 45 days.\nChristian Cooper, portfolio manager for both ETFs, argued that both NANC and KRUZ had, in their own way, beaten the market. NANC returned 37.5 per cent in the year to the end of March, outstripping the 29.9 per cent of the S&P 500, with better Sharpe and Sortino ratios — two measures of risk-adjusted returns.\nKRUZ has done less well, making 25.4 per cent over the same period. However, it has beaten the 22.2 per cent return (with better Sharpe and Sortino ratios) of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which Cooper argued was a fairer comparison given KRUZ’s radically different sector weightings and value stock-laden portfolio.\n“NANC trades like the S&P and KRUZ like the Dow,” he said. \nThis view stems from the ETFs’ wildly different portfolios. The seven largest holdings in NANC are all technology-related companies, headed by Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon.\nSix of the seven are overweighted compared with the S&P 500, with Salesforce held at nearly eight times its market weight. The Democrat top 10 also includes cyber security company CrowdStrike Holdings and API Group, a provider of safety systems, neither of which are even in the S&P. API is also entirely absent from KRUZ’s 487-strong stock portfolio.\nIn contrast, the top holding in KRUZ is oil major Shell — nowhere to be seen among NANC’s 734 stocks — followed by industry peer ConocoPhillips, the 200th-largest holding in NANC. Chevron is also in KRUZ’s top 10, but 181st in NANC.\nThe stark divergence does not end there. Mid-cap industrial Comfort Systems USA is the third-largest position in KRUZ, with fellow mid-cap National Fuel Gas and low-profile energy services company NGL Energy Partners also in the top 10. None of these are anywhere to be seen in NANC.\n“It’s truly astonishing how different they are,” said Cooper. “There are 1,200 names between the funds and the overlap between them is almost non-existent. It’s almost like a psychology test for a world view.”\nKRUZ has just a 3.8 per cent exposure to the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, compared with their 28.7 per cent weighting in the S&P 500 and 35.6 per cent share of NANC. \n“There is perhaps a moral aversion to investing in some of these companies [among Republicans],” Cooper said. “They are coastal companies, they are the global elites that are often maligned in the conservative media their world view gets filtered through.”\nBryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America at Morningstar, said “politically, there is a pretty clear line of demarcation on what types of companies fit within each party”. \n“The Democrat version is 1 per cent energy where the Republican one is almost 14 per cent. Building materials and industrials are the same,” said Armour, who added that while he was not overly surprised “it makes no sense to me that you would invest differently dependent on your political beliefs”.\nRecommended\nCooper believed that each political tribe not only saw the world differently but also was positioning for their respective candidate to win November’s presidential election. \nNANC’s portfolio is “very cloud-focused, tech-focused, the world is fine, we are going to get three [US interest] rate cuts this year. Everything is rosy. That is a world in which [Joe] Biden wins re-election,” he said.\n“The world in which you don’t get rate cuts is diametrically opposed. If you think [Donald] Trump is going to win the election, in that world energy is going to outperform. There are going to be enormous tax breaks for assets like this, 100 per cent that is what is driving [KRUZ’s portfolio],” Cooper added.\nAnd not only do Democrats and Republicans perceive a different future, they even see the present very differently.\n“Our political divide is so stark and so insanely wide that liberals and conservatives literally do not even see the same economy,” Cooper said.\nThis ties in with data on economic sentiment. During the Trump presidency about 60 per cent of Republicans said they believed the US economy was getting better, while only around 10 per cent of Democrats did, according to data compiled by YouGov and The Economist.\nHowever, by the time Biden took office in January 2021, economic sentiment among Republicans had plummeted while Democrats immediately started feeling better about the economy. \nCooper argued that each ETF’s outperformance against what he regards as their respective benchmark suggested the companies overweighted in both ETFs were materially better than the average listed firm.\n“The wisdom of the crowd of Congress having the most access to information and choosing to own them is the secret sauce.”\nArmour was unconvinced by Cooper’s suggestion that the Dow was a fair comparison for KRUZ, however. He also doubted whether NANC’s outperformance reflected any secret sauce.\n“The reason it has done so well is because it’s very tech-heavy,” Armour said. “If the idea is to isolate some sort of insider knowledge, I don’t think this would be the way to do that. I don’t think there is an edge here.”",

        "Title": "Four start-ups lead China’s race to match OpenAI’s ChatGPT",
        "Author": "Eleanor Olcott in Beijing ",
        "Content": "Four Chinese generative artificial intelligence start-ups have been valued at between $1.2bn and $2.5bn in the past three months, leading a pack of more than 260 companies vying to emulate the success of US rivals such as OpenAI and Anthropic.  \nThe newly minted unicorns — Zhipu AI, Moonshot AI, MiniMax and 01.ai — have gained significant backing from a largely domestic pool of investors and are fighting to hire the best talent to develop the most popular AI products. \n“There is no winner of foundation models yet in the China market. These are some of the names leading the charge to claim that title,” said Charlie Dai, vice-president and principal analyst at tech-focused consultancy Forrester. \nUS counterparts outrank Chinese generative AI start-ups in terms of technological development and total fundraising. But with ChatGPT and other breakout AI applications like Character.ai unavailable in China, 262 start-ups are competing to bring out homegrown alternatives, according to a tally by data provider IT Juzi. \nOverall, China’s generative AI start-ups have disclosed a fundraising total of Rmb14.3bn ($2bn) in the first four months of the year, according to IT Juzi, defying a chill in investment running through other areas of consumer technology. However, many start-ups have not disclosed all their fundraising rounds, shielding their war chests from competitors in the rush to hire talent and compete for limited computing resources. \nValuation: $2.5bn based on its latest fundraising round in March. \nFounder: Tang Jie, professor at Beijing’s Tsinghua University, an important breeding ground for AI talent. Chief executive is Zhang Peng, former Tsinghua University computer science professor. \nBackers: Alibaba Cloud, Tencent, Meituan, HongShan, Xiaomi, Qiming Venture Partners, Legend Capital, Hillhouse Capital, National Social Security Fund.\nProducts: Qingyan AI assistant targeting copywriters and coders. It has tailored AI assistants for clients including banks, insurance groups and tech companies. On the consumer side, an avatar chatbot AiU lets users talk with a range of manga characters. \nHeadcount: 800-plus staff based in Tsinghua University Science Park in Haidian, Beijing. \nBeijing has approved more than 40 large language models and related AI applications for public use, while building a supportive regulatory environment that encourages growth in the sector through tax breaks and subsidies. \nZhipu has become China’s biggest AI start-up by number of employees. Spun out of Beijing’s prestigious Tsinghua University, an important breeding ground for AI talent, the over 800-strong company is worth Rmb18bn ($2.5bn) based on its latest fundraising round in March, according to two of its investors. They did not disclose how much they raised.\nMoonshot, set up by Yang Zhilin, a former student of a Zhipu founder, was valued at $2.5bn in a $1bn investment round announced in February. Previously, Yang did an internship at Google Brain AI and Meta AI and founded a start-up called Recurrent AI that analysed calls by salespeople. \nMoonshot, Zhipu and 01.ai have developed chatbots that target office workers and students, who use the digital assistants to digest long texts and optimise search results. Neither Moonshot nor Zhipu responded to requests for comment on their funding.\nMoonshot’s chatbot Kimi, which gets its moniker from Yang’s English name, has emerged as the closest rival to Chinese internet search giant Baidu’s Ernie Bot. Kimi had 12.6mn visits in March compared to its more established competitor’s 14.9mn visits, according to data provider Aicpb.com, but Kimi is growing much faster. \n“Kimi has done a good job on their user interface and contextualising the content through RAG,” said one industry insider, referring to the retrieval-augmented generation technique that enables the models to fetch data from external sources and provide up-to-date answers to users’ queries. \nValuation: $2.5bn, based on $1bn funding round announced in February, led by Alibaba. \nFounder and CEO: Yang Zhilin, AI researcher and key author on an important paper on large language models. Yang is a former student of Zhipu founder Tang Jie at Tsinghua and did internships at Meta AI and Google Brain, mentored by influential AI researchers. He teaches a weekly class at Tsinghua.\nBackers: Alibaba, Xiaohongshu, Meituan, HongShan, ZhenFund and Monolith Management. \nProducts: Kimi chatbot is emerging as the biggest rival to Baidu’s Ernie Bot. \nHeadcount: Around 200 staff based also in the Tsinghua University Science Park.\nBut Kimi has become a victim of its popularity, struggling to cope with demand as users flock to the easy-to-use chatbot that industry experts have praised for its summary tool and for giving clear answers that are highly contextualised. Kimi Bot suffered an outage for two days in March, prompting the young company to issue an apology.\nFaced with the same constrained computing resources, many AI start-ups have chosen to launch avatar chatbots, which do not need to be as good at reasoning as productivity chatbots. These chatbots are trained on smaller amounts of data, thus requiring fewer computing resources. \n“ChatGPT is hard to copy. The model is the product. It is easier to build an avatar chatbot; you can do it on an open-source model with limited computing resources,” said one AI researcher in China. \nZhipu and MiniMax both have avatar chatbots, targeting the world’s largest gaming market with anime-themed characters to banter and flirt with while generating user feedback to iterate their models. Shanghai-based MiniMax is valued at $2.5bn, based on a $600mn funding round announced in March. \n01.ai, founded by AI pioneer Kai-Fu Lee, has launched a series of open-source models called Yi, tailored for the Chinese market and built on Meta’s free-to-adapt Llama architecture. Hugging Face, which tracks open-source models, has ranked several iterations of the Yi models high on its scoreboards for common sense reasoning, maths, coding and reading ability. 01.ai has also launched a productivity chatbot called Wanzhi.\nRecommended\nThe AI start-up recently carried out a fundraising round at a $1.2bn valuation, according to a person with direct knowledge of the deal, and has the backing of Lee’s own venture capital fund Sinovation Ventures, Shunwei Capital, Xiaomi and Alibaba Cloud.\nWith no clear leader or “killer app” emerging in China, it is difficult for customers to select the right provider, said Jeffrey Ding, an expert in China’s AI ecosystem and assistant professor at George Washington University. “It’s very hard to differentiate between all these similar applications. How do you know which company is going to be more effective for your particular situation,” he said. \nValuation: $2.5bn, based on $600mn funding round announced in March. \nFounder and CEO: Yan Junjie, a former executive at SenseTime with a background in computer vision. \nBackers: Alibaba, Tencent, HongShan, Hillhouse and Future Capital. \nProducts: AI avatar chatbots targeting domestic and overseas markets. \nAll four leaders have attracted funding from Alibaba, which has emerged as a key backer of AI start-ups as it looks to replicate the success of Microsoft’s big bet on OpenAI. \nBut the pool of investors funding this crop of start-ups is smaller than previously, with global tech funds not playing the role they did with the last generation of AI surveillance start-ups, including SenseTime and Megvii. \n“Foreign investors are largely sitting this out,” one AI investor noted.\nIn addition to adequate funding, Chinese AI start-ups are finding they have both the engineering talent required to launch competitive products and sufficient computing resources to train existing models — despite US restrictions on advanced chip exports.\n“Chinese cloud computing companies have sufficient stocks of Nvidia GPUs purchased before the ban for start-ups to do this round of model training,” said one employee at an AI start-up who negotiates the terms of cloud computing contracts. \nHowever, two other employees at AI start-ups said they were targeting products that required less compute power, as the industry adapts to the US restrictions. They added that limited computing resources were a key reason why many Chinese AI start-ups were relying on open source models like Meta’s Llama to build their own models and applications, instead of having to use precious computing resources and talent to build a proprietary one from scratch. \n“Chinese AI start-ups are doing a lot of research and development on top of the open source architecture, then fine-tuning the model and contributing to the overall ecosystem,” said Forrester’s Dai. “These start-ups don’t need to do model design and validate the architecture, which is very resource intensive,” he added. \nValuation: $1.2bn based on latest funding round. \nFounder and CEO: Kai-Fu Lee, former president of Google China, founder and former head of Microsoft Research Asia and founder of Sinovation Ventures. \nBackers: Alibaba Cloud, Sinovation Ventures, Shunwei Capital and Xiaomi. \nProducts: Open-source foundational LLM model, AI chatbot and productivity tool for enterprise. \nHeadcount: 200 people in Haidian district, Beijing. \nLow salaries for AI engineers, compared with the US and Europe, are also helping to keep costs down. A recent computer science PhD graduate from a Chinese university can typically expect to command between $80,000 and $240,000 year at a large start-up, a range that is around four times higher in Silicon Valley, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. \n“We’re growing so quickly,” said an employee at one such start-up, noting that the rapidly expanding product and sales team allowed the company to ramp up commercialisation of its technology and court new customers. \nAs one deep-tech investor in China said: “Chinese companies are not good at fundamental tech itself. But they are very good at looking at industry trends, following whatever good comes out, and leveraging their engineering dividend to follow whatever has emerged in the US.” \nAdditional reporting by Andy Lin in Hong Kong ",

        "Author": "George Steer in London and Will Schmitt in New York",
        "Content": "Yield-hungry retail investors piled into highly leveraged US exchange traded funds in April, drawn to volatile markets stoked by uncertainty over the outlook for interest rates.\nInvestors have pushed around $5.2bn into the top 22 leveraged ETFs, which can magnify potential gains and losses, in the year to the end of April, according to VandaTrack, a data company which monitors retail trading flows.\nThe inflows marked a reversal from the first quarter as investors pulled money out of passive funds while the benchmark S&P 500 repeatedly hit record highs. But fresh tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty about the path of US interest rates acted as a “catalyst” for investors to snap up leveraged ETFs “to speculate on the market falling or hedge long exposures,” said Ben Slavin, global head of ETFs at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing.\nData from Morningstar Direct, which covers a broader range of leveraged ETFs, indicated that a surge in retail interest in the last two months has also wiped out the outflows of $4.2bn in January and February. Altogether there were inflows of nearly $4.4bn in March and April, it found.\n“Market timing is often the Achilles heel of day traders, and this time was no different,” said Bryan Armour, Morningstar’s director of passive strategies research. “Most of the top ETFs by March and April inflows had their worst monthly performance of the year in April.”\nAlthough the inflows represent a sliver of the more than $200bn that has poured into the $8.9tn US ETF market this year, it has reawakened concerns that retail investors will be most exposed to sharp falls. Typically they use derivatives to deliver multiples of the daily performance of the benchmark or index they track.\nInvestors who use these sorts of instruments to chase potentially large short-term returns are inherently “much more susceptible to equity pullbacks,” said Marco Iachini, senior vice-president of research at Vanda Track.\nFollowing their introduction in 2006, leveraged ETFs have proliferated across US stock markets. Issuers offer double or triple leveraged funds that can track a range of assets, from other ETFs, or specific indices like home construction or banks, bitcoin futures and popular individual securities like Tesla and Nvidia, among dozens of other securities. There are also leveraged inverse ETFs, which allow investors to hedge their exposure to sharp falls. Leveraged single stocks tend to be more volatile than indices.\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission last year warned investors that over long periods of time the performance of leveraged and inverse ETFs could differ “significantly” from the product it tracks, especially in unstable markets. They have the potential to create “significant and sudden losses”, it added.\nUnlike traditional ETFs, leveraged versions must rebalance at the end of every trading day to deliver their targeted returns. If the price of the underlying asset rises 5 per cent on one day, the value of a corresponding double-leveraged ETF would rise 10 per cent and be required to increase its market exposure before trading starts the next day.\nVandaTrack’s data suggests the products are only becoming more popular. In January, a user of Reddit’s popular Wall Street Bets forum said they had “gambled” $50,000 Canadian dollars on a triple-leveraged long ETF tracking a 20-year Treasury bond index. The ETF has since fallen 31 per cent.",

        "Author": "Peter Campbell and Tim Bradshaw in London and David Keohane in Tokyo",
        "Content": "Japanese conglomerate SoftBank is leading an investment of more than $1bn into UK self-driving car start-up Wayve, marking Europe’s largest artificial intelligence deal to date.\nThe funding round, which also includes Nvidia and existing investor Microsoft, will allow the London-based company to deploy its autonomous systems in cars in the coming years.\nWayve’s new financing is the largest for a European AI start-up, after France-based Mistral raised $415mn in December and Germany’s Aleph Alpha raised $500mn in November. \nThe deal is significant for the UK, which has ambitions of being a global hub of AI research and expertise but has largely failed to grow or retain its most promising companies in the field. \nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said the deal “anchors the UK’s position as an AI superpower”, adding that “the fact that a homegrown, British business has secured the biggest investment yet in a UK AI company is a testament to our leadership in this industry”. \nIt also confirms SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son’s renewed hunt for AI investments with leading start-ups, having previously been slow to deploy capital in the sector compared with rivals, and comes as analysts speculate that he might be working on larger deals.\nWayve, founded in 2017, has developed an AI system that allows vehicles to learn while driving, avoiding the need for costly mapping and expensive laser-based sensors, and potentially allowing self-driving cars to launch in new areas faster and at a lower cost than larger US rivals such as Alphabet’s Waymo.\nThe company is in talks with several carmakers about using its systems, rather than planning to launch its own fleet of vehicles, in coming years.\nWayve hopes to expand its technology from cars to other kinds of robots, describing its approach as “embodied AI” in contrast to online-only chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\nKentaro Matsui, head of new business at SoftBank and a managing partner in its Vision Fund, said Wayve was taking a “very sensible, feet-on-the-ground strategy”. \nMatsui added that it took roughly 18 months from the point Vision Fund met Wayve to formal investment decisions being made. The money, however, is coming from SoftBank, rather than its Vision Funds. Another person familiar with the matter said SoftBank was putting up the substantial majority of the $1.05bn funding round.\nThe deal is among the most significant involving British AI companies since 2014, when Google acquired UK start-up DeepMind, founded by Sir Demis Hassabis, a unit that has become crucial in the Silicon Valley giant’s development of the cutting-edge technology.\n“Wayve is probably the most advanced embodied AI company in the world and it’s here in Britain,” said Suranga Chandratillake, a partner at Balderton Capital, an investor in the company. He added that the start-up provided a “really important foot in the door” for the UK in an increasingly geopolitical race to dominate the next era of computing.\nHowever, there have been doubts about the deployment of self-driving technology in cars, with a number of high-profile accidents and the industry split over its approach.\nTesla, which takes a similar approach to Wayve, has become notorious for chief executive Elon Musk’s overly optimistic predictions of its vehicles’ self-driving capabilities in recent years. But the electric-car maker has increasingly focused on AI in plans to launch so-called robotaxis later this year.\nRecommended\nPooling learning from different types of vehicles all over the world rather than “one constrained city with one type of vehicle” allows Wayve’s system to replicate realistic driving behaviour while still obeying rules of the road, said Alex Kendall, co-founder and chief executive.\nAt present Wayve offers so-called Level 2 automation, which allows for partial autonomous driving and which SoftBank’s Matsui described as “eyes on, hands off”.\nDuring a demonstration to the Financial Times last week in London, a car running Wayve’s first-generation technology felt smooth and natural. It was able to overtake stopped buses, navigate temporary roadworks with unmarked narrow lanes, and leave space for pedestrians climbing out of a parked car while avoiding an oncoming vehicle.\nOnly once during the 40-minute test ride, when a large van refused to give way during a lane merging, did a safety driver intervene with braking and steering.\n“With the feedback from the car manufacturers, we believe that this is going to be a category-defining company,” said Brent Hoberman, whose Firstminute Capital fund is an early investor in Wayve.",

Israel sent ground troops into Rafah last night, seizing the main border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. The Israeli military said it had taken “operational control” of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, at Gaza’s southernmost point, with armour and infantry backed by heavy air strikes. The offensive came just hours after Hamas announced it had accepted a multiphase ceasefire-for-hostage deal brokered by Egypt, Qatar and the US but rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n3. UBS has reported its first quarterly profit since taking over Credit Suisse as the Swiss lender begins to reap the benefits of the contentious rescue of its former arch-rival.

        "Content": "Good morning. We start today with US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen expressing concern over “substantial” rises in living costs being a “problem to a lot of people” as persistent inflation dents President Joe Biden’s standing with voters ahead of November’s election.\nPrices for housing and everyday goods were still high for many voters, Yellen acknowledged, despite strong wage growth in recent months. “They see it when they shop for food. They see it in terms of rentals. With higher mortgage rates, it’s tough for young people who would like to buy a house to enter the market,” Yellen said in an interview with the Financial Times on Thursday.\nThe comments from the US’s most senior economic official come as polls show Biden continuing to trail his Republican rival Donald Trump with just over five months until the presidential election. \nSurveys consistently also indicate respondents do not credit Biden with the US economy’s strong performance in recent months, with inflation still one of their top concerns.

        "Content": "Good morning. We start today with an exclusive story on Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s business empire.\nAdani Group allegedly passed off low-quality coal as far more expensive cleaner fuel in transactions with an Indian state power utility, according to evidence seen by the Financial Times that throws fresh light on allegations of a long-running coal scam.\nThe documents, secured by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and reviewed by the FT, add a potential environmental dimension to accusations of corruption associated with the Indian conglomerate. They suggest that Adani may have fraudulently obtained bumper profits at the expense of air quality, since using low-grade coal for power means burning more of the fuel.\nAdani has denied allegations of fraud, with the group saying the coal had gone through “an elaborate quality check process by multiple agencies at multiple points”.

        "Content": "Good morning. \nThe announcement that the International Criminal Court was seeking arrest warrants for Israel’s leaders just hours after US national security adviser Jake Sullivan held meetings with officials in Jerusalem has left American politicians across the political divide fuming.\nPresident Joe Biden and Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson condemned ICC prosecutor Karim Khan’s statement that he was seeking warrants over alleged war crimes for Benjamin Netanyahu and leaders of Hamas. \nBiden said it was “outrageous” to equate the conduct of Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and defence minister Yoav Gallant with that of Hamas leaders. “Let me be clear: whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas.

        "Content": "Hello and welcome to the working week.\nThere is a sense of final reckoning in the news diary for the next seven days. By this time next week, former US president and likely Republican candidate for November’s poll, Donald Trump, could be a convicted felon — or a newly acquitted man. Closing arguments in the $130,000 “hush money” case could come as early as Tuesday. One key question: will Trump take the stand? Keep up to date with this and other campaign issues via the FT’s US Election Countdown.\nThe week ahead will also be important for two of the biggest scandals of modern British history. Sir Brian Langstaff, chair of the infected blood inquiry, publishes his final report into the events that led to tens of thousands of men, women and children being infected with HIV and hepatitis C through tainted blood transfusions. Read this FT analysis, including heartbreaking stories from the victims, for a sense of the enormity of what has since been labelled the worst treatment disaster in the history of the UK health service.\nThen we have the ongoing inquiry into the wrongful convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters for stealing, actually the fault of the Post Office’s flawed Horizon IT system. The reason this week is so significant in this long-running saga is that former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells, a bête noire of the whole sorry tale, will begin giving evidence to the inquiry on Wednesday. Vennells, who is also being investigated for misleading parliament over the Horizon IT scandal, has already handed back her CBE following calls from the public that she should be stripped of the honour, and she could be reprimanded by MPs for contempt of parliament relating to responses she gave to Westminster committees in 2015.\nStill in the UK, and sticking with controversies, though this time unsettled, Julian Assange’s lawyers will be back in London’s High Court on Monday, when a final decision could be made on the WikiLeaks’ founder’s ability to appeal against the US extradition order.\nOn the other side of the planet, Lai Ching-te will be inaugurated as Taiwanese president on Monday, an important moment amid simmering tensions in the region, as this analysis by FT foreign editor Alec Russell explains.\nThe central bankers are out in force, giving numerous speeches. There is also a fairly healthy data run despite the closures of various financial markets on Monday for the Christian Whitsun festival, and then on Wednesday and Thursday in parts of Asia for Buddha’s birthday (aka Vesak Day). The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) data will provide economic comparators for G7 nations and India in particular, the US Federal Reserve will publish the minutes of its rate-setting meeting, the UK has updates on inflation and retail sales, while Japan publishes its trade and machinery orders data.\nFor monetary policy watchers, China provides its monthly decision on its loan prime rate, while rates are expected to be kept on hold when monetary policy committees meet in Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey.\nShareholder votes are a theme of corporate news, with a meeting organised by Virgin Money to decide whether to accept the takeover bid from Nationwide and investors in Virginia-based drugmaker Indivior deciding whether to move its primary listing to New York. On the earnings front, retail is a theme, notably British high street darling Marks and Spencer and Target in the US. More details below.\nSpring has arrived (at long last) here in London and the most important sign that summer is around the corner arrives this week in the form of the Chelsea Flower Show. My recently discovered love of gardening, as a not so much green-fingered as green behind the ears allotment holder, means that I greatly enjoyed this piece by House & Home writer Alice Vincent. I may well spend much of this week catching the BBC’s annual coverage of the event. But as loyal FT readers know, the real value of Chelsea is in the networking.\nWhat are your priorities for the next seven days?

        "Author": "Cheng Ting-Fang, Lauly Li, Shunsuke Tabeta, Ryan McMorrow, Kim Jaewon, Yifan Yu and Ryohtaroh Satoh",
        "Content": "Hi everyone! This is Cheng Ting-Fang, your #techAsia host for this week.\nDespite being based in Taipei, I can feel the US presidential race heating up thousands of miles away.\nChina is one of the top themes of the Biden campaign, and on Tuesday his administration slapped significantly higher tariffs on multiple Chinese imports. Two items caught my eye: import duties on Chinese semiconductors are set to double to 50 per cent from 2025, and tariffs on Chinese EVs will hit 100 per cent this year\nWashington cited concerns that dumping of cheap Chinese goods could harm the US job market and industries. But a closer look reveals that the seemingly drastic tariff hikes may be little more than paper tigers.\nI dug into China customs data and found the country exported only $2.3bn worth of integrated circuits to the US in 2023, less than 5 per cent of its more than $500bn exports to the world’s biggest economy. And China shipped only $331mn worth of EVs to the US last year, less than 1 per cent of the export total.\nThe majority of key electronic devices, like smartphones and computers, are not assembled in the US. This means limited direct demand for chip imports for American-made end products from China. Similarly, with electric vehicles, Chinese brands have a minimal presence in the US. In short, the tariff hikes seem largely symbolic and unlikely to cause much disruption to US-China trade.\nNevertheless, a clear trend is emerging: Both countries are putting priority on protecting their domestic markets.\nSupply chain executives increasingly use the term “China for China”, indicating a shift towards self-sufficiency and preferring local consumption. This trend, along with similar movements by other governments, reinforces the feeling that the world is moving towards a more bipolar economic landscape.\nChina has finally found a key sector where it has a chance of enhancing its semiconductor presence: automobiles.\nThe government has asked top carmakers, including SAIC Motor and BYD, to aggressively ramp up their use of locally made chips to as much as 25 per cent of the total by next year, with the eventual goal of having all chips sourced domestically, Nikkei’s Cheng Ting-Fang, Lauly Li, and Shunsuke Tabeta write.\nMaking car chips normally does not require the most cutting-edge chip production, so China’s efforts on this front will not be technically impaired by US export controls that have hampered the country’s access to advanced equipment.\nBaidu public relations chief Qu Jing has become a symbol of the brutal workplace culture at Chinese tech companies after releasing a series of rants demeaning staff last week, writes Ryan McMorrow for the Financial Times.\nIn one of the videos, which went viral on Chinese social media, Qu said she did not care about how long hours and extensive business travel would affect her employees’ personal lives. “I’m not your mum,” she said. “I only care about results.”\nShe added that she had the power to make anyone “jobless” in China’s PR industry and that she was so devoted to Baidu that she didn’t know her son’s grade in school.\nQu posted the short videos to teach her team how to use social media to promote Baidu. Instead they struck a chord with workers tired of toiling under over-demanding bosses, landing the Chinese search giant under intense domestic scrutiny.\nBy the end of the week, Qu was out of a job.\nArtificial intelligence is driving a massive transformation in the previously “commodity-like” industry of dynamic random access memory (Dram), Kim Jaewon, Cheng Ting-Fang and Yifan Yu write.\nDram has long been vulnerable to market fluctuations and susceptible to major price swings. But high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a key technology in the AI race, helps add value to traditional Drams. HBM uses a stacking technique to connect several layers of Dram, like a stack of pancakes, to enable faster data transfer and computing. This approach increases bandwidth and with the AI boom still running hot, HBM is expected to capture over 30 per cent of the total Dram market value by next year.\nThe US isn’t the only one putting up trade barriers to Chinese EVs. Washington’s steep tariffs have grabbed headlines, but Brazil is also set to launch several tariff hikes on EVs starting this summer.\nIn anticipation of the potential tariff hikes and other trade restrictions, Chinese EV makers including BYD have been rushing to ship more cars to Mexico and Brazil since March, write Yifan Yu, Lauly Li and Ryohtaroh Satoh of Nikkei Asia.\nThis, in turn, has pushed up demand for container transport, leading to a surge in prices on routes from China to South America — a 55.8 per cent increase between late January and late April. Prices have continued to rise in May.\nVietnam tech start-up VNG becomes Nvidia cloud partner (Nikkei Asia)\nUS and China to hold first talks to reduce risk of AI ‘miscalculation’ (FT)\nLine-Naver spat presents dilemma for Yoon’s Japan policy push (Nikkei Asia)\nUS sharply raises tariffs on Chinese EVs and semiconductor imports (FT)\nSoftBank posts $1.5bn quarterly profit as it shifts to AI investment (FT)\nIndia’s Instagrab: Modi’s re-election bid weaponises social media influencers (Nikkei Asia)\nFoxconn’s Sharp pivots to AI after decision to exit TV display production (Nikkei Asia)\nAlibaba leverages cloud business to become a leading AI investor in China (FT)\nBig Tech regulatory crackdown spreads to Asia and Australia (FT)\nTSMC, MediaTek lead as Taiwan tech makers log 19% sales jump (Nikkei Asia)",

        "Author": "Martin Arnold in Frankfurt, Sam Fleming in London and Claire Jones in Washington",
        "Content": "Claus Romanowsky reckons those who claim Europe’s economy is falling technologically behind are out of touch.\nThe chatbot developed by his team at German engineering company Siemens will soon let factory workers anywhere talk to robots and machines without needing to know any code — potentially reaping massive gains in productivity.\n“If you are a worker coming in to start your shift and a machine is not working, you normally have to wait hours, maybe days, for a programmer,” the Siemens executive says.\n“But now with this chatbot you can just ask it what is wrong and fix it yourself much quicker . . . It is so easy to see the huge potential for this technology.”\nIf more European companies harnessed artificial intelligence in this way, it might help to address some of the deep-seated problems in the region’s economy, which is lagging behind the rip-roaring growth of the US. Europe remains badly behind in AI innovation and adoption. Siemens, for example, needed to team up with American tech giant Microsoft to develop its chatbot.\nEurope’s economic underperformance has long worried policymakers. But it has surged to the top of their agenda now that the growth gap with the US has become even wider following the twin shocks of the coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine.\nYou are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron warned last month that Europe faces a “mortal” threat from economic decline, rising illiberalism and the war on its eastern border.\nUS gross domestic product has proved more resilient to these shocks and rebounded faster from them, rising 8.7 per cent above pre-pandemic levels by the first quarter of this year. That is more than double the 3.4 per cent rise in Eurozone GDP and even further ahead of the 1.7 per cent equivalent increase in the UK economy in the same period.\nThis transatlantic divergence has become so acute that it is creating a rift between the US and Europe on monetary policy. With growth and inflation expected to remain stronger in the US than in Europe, investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates fewer times this year than the European Central Bank or the Bank of England.\nThe combination of high European energy costs, now well above those in the US, and the attractive subsidies offered by Washington for green energy and semiconductor projects built in the country is tempting large numbers of European companies to shift activities there.\nThe scandal for Europe is not low growth, because unfortunately we are accustomed to this. The problem is how to keep a sufficient level of investment [to meet] these new challenges\nThe EU has asked Mario Draghi, Italy’s former prime minister and ex-head of the ECB, to come up with ways of boosting the bloc’s competitiveness. He is expected to recommend deeper integration of EU capital markets and greater centralised funding for defence and other areas from Brussels, warning recently that “without strategically designed and co-ordinated policy actions, it is logical that some of our industries will shut down capacity or relocate outside the EU”.\nEven the head of Norway’s oil fund, one of the world’s biggest investors, says it is “worrisome” how much more hard-working, ambitious and lightly regulated US companies and workers are than those in Europe.\nFaced with an ageing population and a dearth of leading companies in the fastest growing areas of technology, European policymakers are searching for ways to inject dynamism into their economies.\nPaolo Gentiloni, the EU’s economy commissioner, says the question now is how to address the need for critical investments in areas such as the green transition and defence given the sluggish backdrop. \n“The scandal for Europe is not low growth, because unfortunately we are accustomed to this,” he says. “The problem is how to keep a sufficient level of investment, attracting private capital, and supporting with public investment the needs of these new challenges.” \nEurope’s economy was riding high in the early 1990s, enjoying a boost from deepening the EU’s single market before expanding it eastward following the end of the cold war. \nBut since then, the combined economies of the 27 countries that make up the EU today have steadily lost ground to the US, hit by a series of setbacks, particularly the Eurozone debt crisis a decade ago. More recently, the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine have both inflicted more economic damage to Europe than to the US.\nAverage per capita income levels in purchasing-power-parity terms in Europe have fallen to around one-third below those in the US, according to the IMF. What’s more, per capita income in the US has overtaken all the major advanced economies of the EU and the fund forecasts this gap will only widen further over the rest of this decade.\nPart of the problem for Europe has been a paucity of demand growth, weak investment and labour hoarding — where companies retain more workers than needed due to concerns they will struggle to hire them back once demand recovers. \nSome of this stems from a lack of consumer confidence in Europe. House prices have fallen in many countries and governments are reining in spending. Faster US wage growth has helped its workers regain the purchasing power they lost due to high inflation sooner than their counterparts in Europe. US households have also benefited from investing more in equity markets, which have risen sharply in recent years.\n“There are negative wealth effects in Europe,” says Ana Boata, an economist at German insurer Allianz Trade. “If you don’t expect to get more from public welfare or pension systems, you are likely to save more and spend less. Then you add in the uncertainty from wars and you have doom and gloom.” \nYou are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser.\nWealthier and older households in the US have been insulated from higher borrowing costs by the country’s predilection for 30-year mortgages, locking in interest rates at ultra-low pre-pandemic levels. European households have shorter term or variable-rate mortgages, which have eaten up more of their monthly income since rates shot up two years ago.\nIn the Eurozone, people are still saving more than 14 per cent of what they earn — well above the historical average. But US consumers have spent almost all the extra money they put away during the pandemic, reducing their savings to less than 5 per cent of their income.\nPeople in Europe are also choosing to work less — a trend that has intensified since the pandemic — underlined by German train workers successfully pushing to reduce their working week from 38 to 35 hours by 2029 and steel workers demanding to be paid more for working only 32 hours a week. \nThe ECB estimated that at the end of last year the average Eurozone employee worked five hours less than they did just before the pandemic hit in 2020 — equating this to the loss of 2mn full-time workers a year — while the average hours of US workers have remained stable. \n“There is a difference between the work-life balance in the US and in Europe,” says Markus Brunnermeier, a German-born professor of economics at Princeton University. “People’s preferences are very different. Europe’s labour shortages are made worse by this and by demographics. It can be compensated by immigration from eastern Europe, but younger people from this region are going back home or not moving at all.”\nAn extra burden for Europe’s economy stems from its ageing population and falling birth rates, which are already creating widespread labour shortages as the baby boomer generation retire. \nCurrently in the EU there are three working-age individuals for each person aged 65 years or older. But by 2050, the ratio is projected to be less than two working-age individuals for every older person. The US population will age more gently, from just under four working-age individuals for every person aged over 64 today to just under three by 2050, according to the census bureau.\nYou are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser.\nMany EU countries are seeking to keep older workers in the labour force for longer, or to boost female labour force participation. But ageing societies mean that demographic trends are likely to make little contribution to medium-term growth, leaving Europe even more reliant on improvements in productivity. \nHere too, the story is worrying. The US is seen as a more business-friendly and dynamic entrepreneurial environment, which has consistently proved more adept at channelling investment into high-growth sectors including IT. \nIsabel Schnabel, an ECB executive, says the Eurozone has lost about 20 per cent of productivity relative to the US since the mid-1990s, attributing this to the continent’s “failure to reap the benefits of digital technology developments” such as cloud computing and software applications. “It is not that this technological knowledge is not distributed across countries, but it is only a very small share of firms within countries that make efficient use of it,” she says.\nSchnabel adds that many European companies are too small and constrained by regulation to fully exploit new technology. Companies with more than 250 employees account for almost 60 per cent of private sector jobs in the US, but in the EU this falls to between 12 per cent in Greece and 37 per cent in Germany. “Larger firms invest more and are more productive,” she says.\nEurope’s productivity lag is long-standing and enormously costly in terms of living standards. If the biggest five European economies — Germany, the UK, France, Italy and Spain — had matched America’s productivity growth rate between 1997 and 2022, their GDP per capita would on average be nearly $13,000 higher in purchasing-power-parity terms, estimates from the McKinsey Global Institute show. \n“In terms of the productivity gap between the US and Europe, what you’ve seen happening if you measure over the past four years is that [the US] has been mildly disappointing and [Europe’s] been terribly disappointing,” says Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard. “We’re sort of the least ugly horse in the glue factory.” \nPart of the problem has been Europe’s laggardly investment growth. Erik Nielsen, economics adviser at Italian bank UniCredit, says investment in the US had increased more than 8 per cent since the end of 2019 and was still growing strongly at the start of this year, while it remained “terribly weak” in the Eurozone at 4 per cent below pre-Covid levels.\nYou are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser.\nThe differences are stark when the largest companies are examined. The biggest publicly traded European companies with more than a billion dollars of annual revenue, including those in the UK, Norway, and Switzerland, invested $400bn less than their US counterparts in 2022, McKinsey has found. \nVolkswagen was the only EU company that appeared in the top 10 in a recent European Commission report examining the world’s top 2,500 R&D investors in 2023. Six of the top 10 were headquartered in the US and none were in the UK.\nJan Mischke, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, says the investment gap is particularly glaring in IT. The R&D spending of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — amounted to more than $200bn last year, around half of Europe’s total equivalent spending across all private and public sectors. \nEurope, Mischke says, has been building and perfecting a model of “industrial excellence”, but the world is now changing. “There is a massive technological disruption happening where an incremental approach doesn’t cut it.” \nThe mismatch in venture capital funding is stark. Last year VC investment in US companies was almost treble what those in Europe managed, according to KPMG research. VC funds in the US also raised almost five times as much as those in Europe over the past three years.\n“With all the doom and gloom around Europe, this is the big lingering question: is adoption of new AI technology likely to be slower and less beneficial than in the US and China?” says Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “Europe has an understandably cautious approach to regulating new technology but that will be a drawback here.”\nWhile ministers in the EU agree that growth needs to be bolstered, some question how sustainable the US’s current trajectory will be. \n“[It] is not a new issue for Europe and not a new issue for the Netherlands: growth has not been spectacular,” says Steven van Weyenberg, the Dutch finance minister. But looking at the recent performance, he adds: “Part of this story is very loose fiscal policy in the US which may not be sustainable for decades.” \nYou are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser.\nMost EU economies have started to shrink their budget deficits ahead of the reintroduction of binding fiscal rules this year. But US spending has continued to surge. That trend is expected to continue, whoever wins November’s US presidential election. The Congressional Budget Office projects deficits to remain around 6 per cent for each fiscal year over the coming decade.\n“The question is how much longer can the US power ahead, when last year it was mainly driven by a large fiscal stimulus and a big increase in immigration,” says Kaspar Hense, portfolio manager at investor RBC Bluebay Asset Management. “But a Trump presidency could bring more fiscal largesse and we don’t think Biden would be much different.”\nUS productivity was boosted by the temporary surge in unemployment after the pandemic hit in 2020, which reshuffled people into new and more productive roles once activity picked back up. Europe instead chose to protect jobs with massive furlough schemes. “We froze our labour market,” says Boata at Allianz, adding that this resulted in “zombified jobs”. \nYet this pattern could reverse as the US boost wears off and if European companies stop hoarding labour. ECB economists wrote in a blog last week that there were already signs of “weaker tailwinds” in Eurozone job markets, “which in turn will support the increase in productivity” as vacancy levels fall, wages keep rising and hours worked increase.\nThe potential gains from AI represent a substantial key driver and opportunity for Europe . . . to have the economic power to tackle some of its toughest problems\nThe potential gains from AI — such as what Siemens is doing with its chatbot — represent “a substantial key driver and opportunity for Europe . . . to have the economic power to tackle some of its toughest problems,” says Ralph Haupter, Microsoft’s head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He estimates AI could increase productivity of programmers by 40-45 per cent and of office workers by 20-25 per cent.\nThe Eurozone economy showed tentative signs of rebounding from its recent stagnation with quarterly growth of 0.3 per cent at the start of this year. The UK economy grew at an even faster quarterly rate of 0.6 per cent, overtaking US growth of 0.4 per cent in the period. Some policymakers believe many of the region’s problems could be fixed if there was less negativity about the future.\n“There is a risk that the doom and gloom becomes self-fulfilling,” says Schnabel. “Given the huge shocks we have had in Europe, the economic performance has not been as bad as many had feared, so we should stop talking ourselves down.”\nData visualisation by Amy Borrett",

        "Title": "Trading democracy for prosperity is a false choice for Indians",
        "Author": "Raghuram Rajan",
        "Content": "The writer is co-author with Rohit Lamba of ‘Breaking the Mould: India’s Untraveled Path to Prosperity’ and former governor of India’s central bank\nAre Indian voters ignoring the growing authoritarianism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government because of the economic prosperity it has brought? A close look at the data suggests a different story.\nIndia’s economy suffered during the pandemic. Apart from the terrible loss of life, the pandemic decimated small and medium-sized companies, which were already tottering because their cash-based sales were hurt by a prior demonetisation and mismanaged rollout of a goods and services tax. Labour-intensive sectors such as leather and textiles have been disproportionately affected. Of the 23 components of the index of industrial production, 11 labour-intensive sectors were lower in March 2023 than in 2016-17. Worryingly, India’s share in the global garments trade has declined by over 20 per cent since 2015, while Bangladesh and Vietnam’s are surging.\nThe consequences show up in growing urban joblessness. The share of agricultural jobs has been on the rise, an aberration for a growing developing country. Of course, some segments are doing well, given overall GDP growth is north of 6 per cent. The government’s infrastructure push helps capital-intensive sectors such as steel. The rich and upper middle class have ridden the rise in such sectors and in skilled services exports, as well as in stock and property markets.\nA two-paced economy, however, eventually affects the flourishing side. With few new jobs, income growth has been weak for many people. Household indebtedness is rising and consumption of mass goods like motorised two-wheelers is still below pre-pandemic heights. Young people are anxious about their prospects but don’t know whom to blame: a recent white paper on the economy doesn’t even mention the word “unemployment”, while the government-influenced mainstream media trumpets widespread prosperity.\nA government that does not acknowledge the central economic problem cannot propose useful solutions. The ruling party’s jobs strategy has been to attract manufacturing to India through subsidies. The choices are mystifying. Nearly $10bn of subsidies are being allocated to chip manufacturing, which will create only a few jobs for the highly skilled in an industry where India has little comparative advantage. Meanwhile, labour-intensive sectors shrink for want of investment.\nWhy then is the Modi government so popular? It has certainly improved the delivery of benefits such as free food grains (to around 60 per cent of the population). Portrayed as coming directly from the prime minister, such benefits add tremendously to his popularity. So does India’s perceived standing in the world, as its growing economy and the need to keep it on the side of industrial democracies attract gushing dignitaries to New Delhi. But most critical is its ability to influence perceptions by touting good economic news and suppressing criticism. The government is popular despite the lived economic experience of people, not because of it.   \nWill the erosion of democracy, if continued, affect India’s growth? Modi followers emphasise the advantages authoritarian countries have. They can ignore niceties such as careful environmental studies in building out infrastructure. They can support manufacturing, acquiring land for industry over the protests of households, and suppressing unions and wage growth. This is the path once followed by China. But India has two problems Beijing did not have when it embarked on its export-led path. First, China got there first, and is competing away the profits in manufacturing. Second, the industrial world is not ready for another China, eating into what remains of their manufacturing and expanding goods production to the detriment of the climate.   \nIndia should build on its strengths, including services exports and democracy. For instance, it already has 300,000 engineers working on chip design for companies across the world. Why not repurpose chip subsidies to improve the quality of its schools, colleges and universities, so it can have more chip designers, and eventually its own Nvidia or Qualcomm?\nAn Indian path will entail risks and the government will make mistakes. A strong opposition and a free press will help point these out, enabling it to correct course. Stronger democracy will also make India a more trusted destination for foreign investors, and a more reliable provider of data-intensive services. The factors electors need to weigh in the Indian elections are not as straightforward as giving up democracy for prosperity. Indeed, the frightening possibility is that India gives up both.\nLetter in response to this article:\nModi has given Indians confidence to succeed / From Sreeram Iyer, Singapore",

        "Author": "Harriet Agnew in London",
        "Content": "The Edinburgh International Book Festival has ended a 20-year partnership with its lead sponsor Baillie Gifford after the withdrawal of several authors and threats of disruption from activists, prompting the festival’s chair to warn that “funding for the arts is now in a perilous position”.\nThe announcement follows a similar move last week by Hay Festival, which suspended its sponsorship from the £225bn asset manager after boycotts from speakers and performers over the Edinburgh-based private partnership’s purported links to Israel and the fossil fuel industry.\nAllan Little, chair of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, warned on Thursday that “the future of festivals like ours — and all of these benefits these events bring to authors and readers alike — is in jeopardy.”\nAn open letter from lobby group Fossil Free Books earlier this month had called on Baillie Gifford to “divest from the fossil fuel industry and from companies that profit from Israeli apartheid, occupation and genocide”.\nStaff at Hay Festival were being individually targeted on social media and accused of complicity in genocide, according to people familiar with the situation.\nJenny Niven, chief executive of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, said the pressure on the team and their colleagues at Baillie Gifford “has simply become intolerable”. The festival is scheduled for August.\nFossil Free Books said it welcomed the news, adding it was “grateful” to the festival “for showing leadership and listening to its authors and workers”.\nBaillie Gifford is a long-standing investor in companies seeking to drive the transition to clean energy and holds large positions in the likes of electric-car maker Tesla and Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt.\nOnly 2 per cent of its clients’ money is invested in companies with some business related to fossil fuels, compared with the market average of 11 per cent. The firm is a large investor in multinational tech companies, including Amazon, Nvidia and Meta.\nFossil Free Books has said some of Baillie Gifford’s holdings — among them Cemex, Cisco Systems and Booking Holdings — have been condemned by rights organisations for their business involvement in Israeli settlements in occupied Palestine.\nBaillie Gifford has said these are multinational companies whose operations in the occupied Palestinian territories are small in the context of their overall business and no sanctions prohibit them from doing business there. \nNick Thomas, a partner at Baillie Gifford and a prominent patron of the arts, said: “The activists’ anonymous campaign of coercion and misinformation has put intolerable pressure on authors and the festival community . . . we hold the activists squarely responsible for the inhibiting effect their action will have on funding for the arts.”\nHe added: “The assertion that we have significant amounts of money in the occupied Palestinian territories is offensively misleading.”\nThomas said: “Demanding divestment from these global companies, used by millions of people around the world, is unreasonable and serves no purpose. Much as it would be unreasonable to demand authors boycott Instagram or stop selling books on Amazon.”\nBaillie Gifford’s support for the Edinburgh International Book Festival began in 2004 as a philanthropic initiative by its partners. The firm took over as lead sponsor from Royal Bank of Scotland in 2013 — a “six-figure sum” each year, according to a person familiar with the situation.\nIn recent years Baillie Gifford’s sponsorship has focused on a programme that supports Scottish school students to attend the festival free of charge, meet authors and receive a free book.\nOrganisations with alleged links to Israel have come under pressure from pro-Palestinian activists in recent months as the country has been accused of genocide in a case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice.\nThe accusation was levelled over Israel’s offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 people, according to Palestinian health officials. Israel has rejected the claims of genocide as entirely false.\nThe offensive was launched in response to Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, in which militants killed about 1,200 people and seized 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.",

        "Title": "Britain’s got AI talent but that’s not enough",
        "Author": "John Thornhill",
        "Content": "It’s the kind of crazily ambitious investment that seemingly only happens in Silicon Valley near the top of a hype cycle: a pre-product, lossmaking artificial intelligence start-up raises $1.05bn from SoftBank, Microsoft and Nvidia to fund a dizzying ambition for global domination. In fact, this deal was sealed in London last week when Wayve, which develops software for autonomous vehicles, announced Europe’s largest AI start-up fundraising.\nIf any British technology company is to match chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s desire to create a homegrown Microsoft over the next decade worth more than $1tn, then Wayve is probably as good a bet as any. As a global pioneer in the white-hot field of embodied AI — interacting and learning from the environment — Wayve could sell the software for millions of self-driving cars if it spends its money wisely and executes its plans impeccably. “Embodied AI is going to be a sector that produces trillion-dollar companies,” says Alex Kendall, Wayve’s co-founder and chief executive. “And certainly our ambition is to be one of those.”\nThe seven-year history of Wayve highlights the strengths of the UK tech industry: foundational research from a world-leading university; early financing from a vibrant start-up funding community; and a flexible post-Brexit regulatory regime that accommodates new technology. But Wayve’s latest funding round also exposes one of London’s lingering flaws: the growth capital needed to accelerate the company’s expansion has come from abroad. If Wayve delivers on its promise, it will now be foreign investors who benefit most.\nThat may not matter much to Wayve, which has already opened an office in Silicon Valley and outgrown the UK, as indeed it must if it wants to be a global industry leader. “Our roots in Cambridge and London are very important to me personally. But we are a global company building a global product,” the New Zealand-born Kendall, who was a star academic at Cambridge university before founding Wayve, tells me in a video interview from Seattle.\nIt has been a good month for London’s reputation as a world AI hotspot. Last week, two fast-growing US companies — Scale AI, a training data company, and CoreWeave, an AI-focused cloud computing provider — announced they were opening their European headquarters in London. In addition, CoreWeave is investing $1bn in data centres in the UK. Hunt has also been busy plugging Britain’s merits to tech leaders at the chancellor’s Buckinghamshire estate at Dorneywood this week.\nBritain boasts several top-ranked universities churning out AI researchers as well as the global talent magnet that is Google DeepMind, which ranks among the strongest industrial AI labs in the world with more than 2,000 employees. “At the end of the day, talent still matters most in this space. London is incredibly important,” says Jordan Jacobs, managing partner of Radical Ventures, a specialist Toronto-based AI investment fund. \nBut before British politicians indulge in too much congratulatory backslapping, it is worth noting how fast the AI industry is developing in the rest of the world, most notably in China, France and the United Arab Emirates, and questioning how far the benefits of the AI revolution are being diffused through the rest of the economy. \nAt the top of the AI food chain, the giant US tech companies still dominate. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, the Magnificent Seven AI-obsessed US tech companies — Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla — spent $200bn on research and development last year — about half the total equivalent public and private sector spending in Europe. US start-ups also attracted 73 per cent of the $42.5bn invested globally in the AI sector last year, according to data firm CB Insights. In such a US-dominated world, Britain is at risk of becoming little more than a research offshoot.\nAs a recent paper published by the AI Now Institute noted, Britain’s much-trumpeted success in AI across a narrow range of metrics has obscured a spasmodic policy framework, poor computing infrastructure and a squandering of public sector data, invaluable for training AI models. Since 2010, Britain has announced 11 different growth plans or industrial strategies, none of which has spurred significantly higher investment. Britain accounts for just 1.4 per cent of total global computing capacity, behind Italy, Russia and Finland.\nBritain certainly has good reason to applaud its ambitious AI researchers and entrepreneurs. But the country desperately needs to deepen and broaden adoption of the technology if it is to reap its full benefits.\njohn.thornhill@ft.com",

        "Title": "PolyAI secures near $500mn valuation in boost to UK’s AI ambitions",
        "Author": "Stephanie Stacey in London",
        "Content": "London-based PolyAI has secured a valuation of close to $500mn from new investors including chipmaking giant Nvidia, in the latest successful fundraise by an artificial intelligence start-up based in the UK.\nThe company, which produces AI voice assistants for call centres, said it has closed a new $50mn funding round led by Hedosophia, a group run by investor Ian Osborne, and NVentures, the venture capital arm of Silicon Valley heavyweight Nvidia.\nThere was also participation from existing investors in PolyAI, including Khosla Ventures, an early backer of OpenAI, and Steve Cohen’s Point72 Ventures.\nThis investment is another boost for the UK’s ambitions of becoming a global hub for AI research and development, having so far failed to grow and retain many of its most promising companies in the sector. Last week, UK self-driving car start-up Wayve raised $1bn from investors including Japan’s SoftBank, marking Europe’s largest AI deal to date.\nPolyAI chief executive and co-founder Nikola Mrkšić, who previously worked on Apple’s Siri voice assistant, said the company’s technology will address call centre worker shortages with customer support AI assistants that are able to conversationally guide customers through complex inquiries. “We want to make people fall in love with voice assistants because [calling] is still the main way people interact with businesses”, said Mrkšić. “It’s been very sticky and has stayed past a digital transformation elsewhere.” \nMrkšić founded PolyAI in 2017 with Tsung-Hsien Wen and Pei-Hao Su, who he met at Cambridge university’s Dialogue Systems Group, part of the institution’s Machine Intelligence Lab. \nThe start-up uses its own proprietary large language model as well as technology from ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The company said it worked with linguists to build voice assistants that reflect human speech patterns, such as by lengthening vowels when checking a reservation.\nPolyAI made more than $10mn in revenue in 2023 and is on track to triple that figure this year, according to a person familiar with the company’s finances. \nIt typically charges clients per minute of calling time and has worked with businesses ranging from casino groups to utility companies, logistics firms, and banks, according to Mrkšić.\nOne of the company’s biggest challenges for growth will be overcoming consumers’ anger over previous attempts to bring automation to customer support. “People are still not in love with these things,” said Mrkšić. \nA report from the UK’s Institute of Customer Service in January found that customer satisfaction levels had fallen to their lowest since 2015 — in part due to complaints about automated chatbots.\nOther start-ups competing in the sector include German company Parloa, which said in April it had raised $66mn to expand its own conversational customer service platform, and San Francisco-based Rasa Technologies, which raised an additional $30mn in February to further develop its software for building text and voice-based AI assistants.",

        "Title": "The next wave of AI hype will be geopolitical. You’re paying",
        "Author": "Bryce Elder",
        "Content": "A popular view of generative AI is that it’s unjustifiably expensive, chronically wasteful, rarely useful, and is being foisted on the general public for ideological reasons even though it makes the services they rely on worse. Governments are sure to be all over it. \nSo says Barclays: \nThe initial wave of AI is well under way, largely driven by billions of hyperscale dollars. The concern with Nvidia, and ultimately with the second wave of AI ecosystem, is where the next pocket of dollars comes from once hyperscale capex can’t shift further toward AI or grow meaningfully year-on-year.  \nIn recent months, we have seen a growing initiative from nations around the world to quickly educate themselves and remain at the forefront of AI’s powerful potential. In a practical sense, this has amounted to public announcements for multi-hundred million and even billion-dollar spending plans from several nations (Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Germany, UK, India), which will go toward supporting the AI hardware ecosystem. \nPrivate-sector AI cash burn is already sovereign-sized. The combined capex of Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft will be around $200bn this year, according to Bernstein Research. \nThese sunk costs need to deliver some kind of return by the time the depreciation charges reach their income statements. A continued acceleration of capex growth depends on companies finding something that the public wants to buy. Their need for revenue may soon become urgent, and concepts so far have not been encouraging.\nBut because political leaders care more about one-upmanship than ROIC, taxpayer-subsidised AI can continue to boom even if the corporate bubble bursts. \nBarclays estimates in a recent note that if nations ex-China matched US’s $4bn of AI spending, scaled to GDP, it'd add another $3.5bn:\nFor Nvidia, that adds up to barely a month’s revenue. The more important thing is the replacement cycle. \nBarclays estimates that hardware purchases will become obsolete within two years. As AI hardware becomes bigger and more expensive, aggregate annual sovereign spending can easily exceed $25bn very quickly:\nOverall, we see AI as the most powerful enabler of technological progress, as well as a major security risk as adversarial nations increase capabilities, ultimately justifying our estimated spend and giving us confidence that the numbers should move materially higher. \nThe US has taken an early lead because its government has been relatively enthusiastic about AI. There was a Federal Use Case Inventory published in September that identifies more than 700 possible applications, and a Senate Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence Policy earlier this month proposed an R&D budget of $32bn.\nThough such figures may prove fanciful, the bigger costs are much less scrutinised. The Senate road map does not include defence, which appears to account for nearly all current US federal AI spending. \nA study of government tenders published by the Brookings Institution in March found that the US Department of Defense was ramping up AI investment aggressively in 2022. By maximum potential contract value, just over $4bn of the $4.56bn in AI procurement costs last year were for the defence agency, Brookings calculates. \nSenate majority leader Chuck Schumer has said the US AI defence budget needs to increase by approximately eightfold. The exact purpose of all this investment will remain classified information. \nCountries following the America’s lead will want something built in-house that’s at least equivalent to OpenAI’s GPT-4, says Barclays. Last year’s best technology represents “the minimum starting point for nations attempting to remain at the forefront of AI for both economic and security purposes”. \nProcessor blades for such a rig costs will cost $600mn at current prices, plus the same again to cover interconnects, storage, power costs, etc. What such a set-up won't do is scare the enemy. That requires staying at AI’s bleeding edge, which will be a lot more expensive. \nTraining GPT-4 is said to have used 25,000 accelerator cards, whereas GPT-3 — released less than three years earlier — needed just 1,000. The below grid gives an approximate idea of current all-in build costs in increments of ten thousand accelerators, or XPUs. \nIf hardware cost inflation continues at the current pace, the cost of one best-in-class AI computing cluster could easily exceed $5bn, says Barclays:\nThe infowars arms race will escalate so quickly, only about 15 nations can afford to take part, says Barclays. And for those able to pay there’s no option to back down, it says, because “AI capabilities have become one of the most important, if not the most important, national initiatives globally”:\nIn our view, global development of AI applications will undoubtedly become a national security issue no different than how the government views domestic leading-edge chip production, and under the lens of the ~$39bn CHIPS Act passed several years ago, we see adequate room in the government budget for increased spending on new clusters and more advanced hardware once readily available.\nFurthermore, we believe new AI/compute investment plans put forth by Saudi Arabia ($40bn AI investment fund according to the New York Times), Singapore, Germany, and even India could push policymakers to act sooner rather than later on writing more robust AI investment plans into policy\nSo buy Nvidia, Barclays tells clients. The stock might look expensive, with an attached heap of risks related to sanctions and antitrust, but civil servants won’t know any better than to buy servers off the shelf: \nWe see NVDA as the largest beneficiary of Sovereign AI given its already dominant share of the merchant AI accelerator installed base, performance leadership, and preference from the developer community. We also see the Sovereign AI market as a strong potential adopter of the company’s full rack solution [ . . . ] given government agencies’ lack of engineering know-how and resources required to assemble custom solutions around merchant hardware. Overall, we view the projected spend from Sovereign AI as additive to the entire AI ecosystem, and thus believe it will trickle down to the broader AI ecosystem as well. \nAnd sure. Why not. Once a trailing PE goes above 300x, anything goes. \nBeing an ESG darling was a big part of last year’s Nvidia buy case. A year earlier it was adjacent to the shitcoin bubble, and before then it was mostly about Cyberpunk 2077 frame refresh rates. Now it’s a buy because it’s the de facto weapons supplier for World War GPT. \nOne common thread that links Nvidia’s customers and shareholders is that they don't know what they are buying, or why they need it, but are sure they have to have it. An international arms race for billion-dollar boondoggles and tiger-repelling rocks would fit this description perfectly. \nFurther reading:— ‘Sell Nvidia’ (FTAV)",

        "Content": "When Roaring Kitty made a sudden, possibly faked and definitely spammy return to social media it triggered a surge in GameStop and adjacent 2021-era meme stocks, and excitement that another massive wave of hedge fund-wrecking short-squeezing was under way.\nThis time — true believers hope, at least — it might even be the mythical “REAL” short squeeze that will ruin all hedge funds, topple the entire global financial system and make diamond-hand apes fabulously wealthy in the process. \nAs Bryce noted at the time, some short positions in GameStop were shaken out, but this wasn’t a 2021 redux. In fact, the overall squeeze on short US equity positions has been notable, but it doesn’t even compare to those that happened around other big market turns like December 2023 and April 2020. \nGoldman Sachs’ basket of the most shorted stocks by hedge funds has jumped by 25 per cent in recent weeks, flipping a 10 per cent year-to-date loss through April to a 7 per cent gain. But compared to the 2021 earthquake this has just been a minor tremor. \nMoreover, thanks to the performance of popular longs like Nvidia, Meta and TSMC, hedge funds are generally doing well, with the average US long-short equity hedge fund up 8 per cent so far this year, according to estimates from Goldman’s prime brokerage. Here’s how Goldman’s “VIP” index of popular hedge fund longs have done versus the equal-weighted S&P 500 and a basket of the most popular short positions:\nMost of all, despite all the online fury, single-stock short sellers seem to be going the same way as switchboard operators, town criers and broomsquires. \nOK that’s a slight overstatement, but, as FTAV has pointed out before, there’s just a lot less of it around, with most shorting migrating away from individual stocks and towards index-level hedging. \nMedian short interest in S&P 500 companies has picked up a little lately, but remains near historical lows, and for the US stock market as a whole it is negligible:\nMaybe we see a bit more action in the coming weeks, but there’s just not enough kindling out there to ignite the kind of short inferno that we saw in early 2021. Not that this will stop the “superstonkers”. ",

        "Title": "The great American innovation engine is firing again",
        "Author": "John Thornhill",
        "Content": "There is a view, pungently expressed by the venture capital investor Bill Gurley, that Silicon Valley has thrived because it is 2,850 miles west of the centre of federal government. “The reason that Silicon Valley has been so successful is because it is so fucking far away from Washington DC,” Gurley told a cheering audience last year.\nBut that view ignores a significant historical inconvenience: Silicon Valley was mostly built with federal dollars. The Pentagon and Nasa were the first, and voracious, purchasers of silicon chips to guide their military and civilian rockets. By 1963, the Apollo space programme was buying 60 per cent of all the integrated circuits produced in the US. \nOnce again, the US federal government is back in the game of funding technology in a big way, promising to unleash a further wave of private sector investment and innovation. \nThe US has both the intent and the capability to reassert global technological leadership, while hobbling China’s rise. And Silicon Valley is likely to be among the biggest beneficiaries of that political ambition, even if some of its leading luminaries do not yet appreciate it. The rest of the world might have fondly hoped it would one day overtake the US in several strategic sectors, but other nations look more like the yapping dog failing to catch the car.\nThis week, the Semiconductor Industry Association published a report highlighting how the adoption of the Chips Act in 2022, which provided $39bn of grant incentives to support the semiconductor industry, had primed a torrent of private sector investment. An additional $447bn of investment has since been announced in 83 separate projects across 25 states. The report forecasts that the US will now increase its share of global manufacturing capacity for leading edge chips (below 10 nanometres) to 28 per cent of the total by 2032 from 0 per cent today.\nJust as the Sputnik moment of 1957, after the Soviet Union’s launch of the first satellite, triggered a surge of technological investment in the US, so the current superpower rivalry with China has similarly loosened federal spending in the tech sector. Washington finally realised that its reliance on chip imports from Taiwan and South Korea was an unacceptable strategic vulnerability in a more volatile world. \n“The idea that 75 to 85 per cent of our chips were being made in east Asia was unsustainable,” John Neuffer, the president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, tells me. “We are spreading the peanut butter more broadly.”\nHowever, the federal government’s ambitions extend beyond semiconductors. The Inflation Reduction Act, also passed in 2022, is stimulating a significant wave of investment in climate tech. And the Biden administration aims to bolster US strengths in the biotech and quantum sectors, too. It recognises that the US has previously failed to capitalise on its early technological lead in some critical areas — telecommunications infrastructure equipment and batteries, for example — and does not want to repeat that mistake. \nThere is, of course, only so much that Washington can do. But the US private tech sector is independently enjoying a surge of new funding as investors bet big on the transformative power of artificial intelligence. US companies, led by Google, OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft and Anthropic, already dominate the field of generative AI. Goldman Sachs estimates that AI-related investment could rise to between 2.5 per cent and 4 per cent of GDP in the US, compared with 1.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent in other leading economies.\n“This is a genuine breakthrough,” says Erik Brynjolffson, director of the digital economy lab at Stanford University. \nNot only will generative AI sharpen the competitiveness of US companies, it will boost the overall economy, too. While the Congressional Budget Office is forecasting average annual productivity growth of 1.4 per cent over the next decade, Brynjolffson predicts it will be closer to 3 per cent, mostly thanks to AI. “It will roughly double the rate of productivity growth,” he tells me.\nIt is doubtless true that economies running a budget deficit of 6 per cent of GDP and enjoying an AI-hyped stock market boom can look deceptively good — at least for a while. America’s weaknesses, including threadbare transport infrastructure and skills shortages, will not be easily overcome. US restrictions on high-end chip exports to China will hurt US companies too. And political turmoil following this year’s presidential elections cannot be ruled out. But as the legendary investor Warren Buffett preaches: “Never bet against America.”\njohn.thornhill@ft.com\n",

They have all been developing local versions of US applications such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Character.ai’s avatar chatbot.\nIn one example, Alibaba led a $1bn fundraising round in Moonshot AI that valued the start-up at $2.5bn in February. It put $800mn into the developer of the fast-growing Kimi AI chatbot, with just under half coming in the form of cloud computing credits, according to two people familiar with the deal. Alibaba declined to comment.\nOver the past year, Alibaba chief executive Eddie Yongming Wu has personally overseen investments in the four leading AI start-ups, according to people familiar with the matter, as the company seeks to reinvent itself as an AI innovator.\nThe splurge in investment comes at a pivotal time for Alibaba. It is trying to chart a new path as it grapples with rising competition from ByteDance and PDD Holdings in its core ecommerce market and after the chaotic unwinding of its ambitious restructuring plan, under which its cloud business was supposed to pursue an initial public offering.\nAlibaba cancelled that plan in November, citing the impact of US chip restrictions. Wu then took direct control of the cloud business, pledging to invest in AI and putting the business at the centre of his strategy to boost growth.\nThe cloud arm had been averaging single-digit quarterly growth since 2022, following Beijing’s crackdown on large internet companies. Its profitability has lagged far behind that of US rivals such as AWS.\nCharlie Dai, vice-president and principal analyst at tech consultancy Forrester, said Alibaba was “facilitating the start-ups by offering a public cloud platform with comprehensive capabilities boosted by its broad ecosystem for their open-source models” while generating new revenue for its cloud business by providing computing resources to train their models.\nThe structure of Alibaba’s investment in Moonshot echoes those of Microsoft and Amazon, under which cash is transferred to AI start-ups on the agreement that they will use the money to train and run models on Azure and AWS servers, respectively.\nHowever, as one person noted, the difference with Alibaba’s investment is that the money is never transferred to the Chinese start-ups. Instead, it is held in an escrow account that the company can count as incoming revenue.\nComputing-for-equity offers are more enticing in China, where cloud resources are scarce due to US restrictions on the export of advanced chips. “Providing compute is actually more valuable than cash,” said one Chinese AI scientist. “With the shortage of semiconductors, it’s very hard to get access to a 10,000 GPU [processing] cluster, which Alibaba has.”\nSocial media group Xiaohongshu is pursuing an even more creative investment method, offering increased traffic for the start-ups’ products through promotiona on its popular Instagram-like platform in exchange for equity, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Xiaohongshu did not respond to a request for comment.\nChina’s major internet companies, including Alibaba, Meituan, Xiaohongshu and Tencent, are playing an outsized role in financing this wave of start-ups compared with the previous crop of AI start-ups dominated by surveillance groups SenseTime and Megvii. \nDuring that phase of the investment wave, which peaked between 2017 and 2019, large tech investors such as Tiger Global and SoftBank, along with a wide pool of domestic venture capital firms, competed with the internet giants for deals.\nBut deteriorating relations between Beijing and Washington and a downturn in China’s VC industry over the past two years have made today’s crop of AI start-ups more reliant on financing from domestic internet companies, which in turn means they have less negotiating power when determining the price for cloud services, said one person with knowledge of the deals.\nAlibaba has become a top investor just as it seeks to monetise its hoard of AI chips. Alibaba Cloud purchased high-end Nvidia graphics processing units, including large orders of the watered-down A800 and H800s series, before the US restricted advanced chip sales to Chinese companies. It has them in data centres in China and south-east Asia, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nRecommended\nThe cloud provider is seeking to capitalise on these chips before they lose their value when Nvidia releases its next generation of AI processors. Alibaba will be barred from buying the new chips under Washington’s tightened export controls, said one person close to the company.\nWu’s focus on AI investments represents a new chapter for Alibaba after a regulatory crackdown on its alleged monopolistic behaviour starting in 2021 required it to divest stakes in other internet companies under pressure from regulators.\nAlibaba has become such a pivotal backer of AI start-ups in China that industry insiders have started to joke: “If you want to invest in China AI, just buy Alibaba stock. It’s a China AI ETF,” said one manager at an Alibaba-backed AI start-up.",

        "Title": "Is now the time to buy Japan?",
        "Author": "Leo Lewis",
        "Content": "In late February, Nomura Securities, Japan’s biggest brokerage house, took the highly unusual step of inviting journalists into its headquarters in the heart of Tokyo’s financial district. Employees ushered them to the inner sanctum of its equities trading floor — a quietly frenetic, L-shaped chamber, usually strictly off limits to outside eyes.\nBut this day was different. The Nikkei 225 Average of major Japanese stocks had been on a powerful rally since January and, closely followed by Japanese media and the general public, was about to smash through its all-time high — a level set in 1989, at the peak of the biggest stock bubble in human history. \nBut history, Nomura sensed, was finally about to be overtaken by momentum.\nWhen the record was broken, the traders burst into applause. The big number — the Nikkei at 40,000 points — certainly told a neat story: after years of promised reform and resurgence, Japan was back. The country of Toyota, Sony, Tokyo Electron, SoftBank and Uniqlo was emergent, at last, from its “lost decades” of economic stagnation, falling prices and zero wage growth. \nBy the end of March, and with foreign investors tentatively buying into the euphoria, the combined market capitalisation of Tokyo-listed stocks hit quadrillion territory — ¥1,000tn — for the first time. And all of this happening while China, for geopolitical reasons, was becoming less of a destination for western capital. \nAs one fund manager put it to me: “For 30 years, the investment has been all about Asia ex-Japan. Now the biggest game in town is Japan ex-Asia.” \nIt has been a time for UK investors, among others, to look afresh at Japan, a country that, 35 years ago, presented a story of astounding expansion and acquisition and seemed poised to overtake the US as the world’s biggest economy. But is now the time to buy — or are investors simply getting caught up in a great story? \nThe resurgence of the Japanese stock market certainly makes for a compelling narrative, but it’s one that is yet to convince completely, particularly as the sharp decline in the yen has wiped out much of the dollar- or euro-denominated gains made by foreign equity investors this year.\nFor some, the Japanese story is one of unlocking trapped value. For others, it is about re-rating the country as a pivotal tech player.\n“Japan is the perfect market to invest in for anyone who thinks that they’ve missed the boat on US tech stocks,” says Pelham Smithers, a longtime Japan analyst. For investors who wished they’d got into Nvidia, he counts more than 50 Japanese stocks related to AI, from SoftBank Group, owner of chip designer Arm, to Hitachi, provider of arguably the largest industrial AI platform in the world. “You get all this for about half the valuations you pay for the Nasdaq Composite,” he says. \nScott MacLennan is less enthusiastic. The global equity portfolio manager at Schroders in London has spent a week in Tokyo visiting companies and attending presentations aimed at foreign investors. “My overriding sense is that, while the Japanese market is still at a very exciting juncture . . . it is important to be mindful that after a period of sustained strength we may now be moving into a period of digestion,” he says. “I would be cautious about getting too bullish, even if it is very attractive on a multiyear basis.”\nIt is a caution that, for now, seems widely shared. Since its epic breakthrough three months ago, the Nikkei 225 has traded sideways. The much broader Topix index, though up a respectable 15 per cent year to date (in local currency terms), has also lost much of the energy with which it began the year. \nJapanese companies have certainly been working to meet investor expectations for greater returns on equity and a greater focus on the cost of capital. Share buyback announcements by Japanese companies in the last financial year exceeded ¥10tn for the first time ever, according to Goldman Sachs strategist Bruce Kirk, and he estimates that a record ¥1.2tn of buybacks were then announced in April. Still, net buying of Japanese stocks by foreign investors — including individual investors in the UK — has been relatively anaemic.\nThere is background excitement around the introduction, in January, of an expanded tax-protected investment scheme (structured much like a UK Isa and known as Nisa) and its capacity to draw into the Tokyo stock market some of the $7tn that Japanese households currently hold in cash. \nThe so-called “Mrs Watanabes” — a moniker given to stereotypical keepers of the family purse strings — are generally conservative, but deflation has made them more so. When prices were stagnant or falling, there was no pressing need to take risks seeking higher returns on savings. That hoard of cash and deposits represents more than half of the households’ total financial assets, and is a far higher ratio than their peers in the US, UK and Europe, and than the worldwide average of 28.6 per cent.\nFor a country that has accumulated such vast household financial assets — ¥2.1 quadrillion at the end of June 2023 — it is remarkable how little has flowed into the stock market. \nNow, the Japanese government and Tokyo Stock Exchange are aligned in a quest to change that.\nBrokerage firms are desperate to loosen investor caution, both domestically and globally. At the end of May, two conferences held in Tokyo by Morgan Stanley MUFG and CLSA, drew an estimated 1,500 fund managers from around the world. Among them were sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East, pension funds from Canada and Latin America, and family offices representing significant pools of Chinese, Indian and South East Asian wealth.\nThey had arrived at the right time, one delegate told me, the manager of a large global fund that does not comment officially to the media. “A lot of investors and analysts are focused on the many changes that are going on at Japanese companies.” \nWhether that change is coming from the Tokyo Stock Exchange cajoling companies into being better stewards of shareholder equity, or the government making it easier for companies to consolidate, or whether it is big activists like Elliott and ValueAct coming to shake things up, there is clearly change happening, he adds.\n“But from my point of view, the really important factors at work here are macro ones, and the background has never been so bullish,” he says. “We are moving from the world of zero — where inflation, wage growth and interest rates were all negligible — to the world of two, where inflation, interest rates and wage growth are all rising. That’s a big, investable change.” \nMorgan Stanley’s conference began with an appearance by the prime minister, Fumio Kishida — a leader whose approval ratings are extremely low, but who has been at the helm just as many of the biggest economic policy initiatives of the “Abenomics” programme of the late Shinzo Abe have borne fruit.\nKishida’s message was straightforward — and, according to at least one delegate, calculated to address the sort of criticism that has held many global investors back from taking the plunge. \nJapan has broken free of the deflation that held it down for a quarter of a century, the PM said, and, as prices begin to rise, so household and institutional investors will feel pressure to build themselves a hedge against inflation. Japan will transition to a new growth-oriented economy. \n“In order to financially support this virtuous economic cycle, we are strongly promoting the establishment of an asset management nation,” said Kishida.\nAs that process works itself through, and the “Mrs Watanabe” Japanese households become more actively invested in Tokyo stocks, valuations across the entire market would increase. The current price-to-earnings ratio of the Topix index of 17x, estimates Morgan Stanley, could rise to 20x by the end of 2030 in a base case, and 22x in a bull case.\n“Why is this time different?” was the question posed by CSLA’s Japan strategist Nicholas Smith, at the investment group’s conference several days later. The market has had rallies at various points over the past three decades, often driven by narratives of market reform or some fundamental change in the activities of households, companies and the economy as a whole. Those rallies consistently proved shortlived and left many investors badly singed.\nSmith’s line, which investors at the conference generally agreed was persuasive, was that, this time, they were watching something extraordinary. Inflation is back; the odds of the Bank of Japan raising interest rates before October are rising; wage increases in 2024 have been the largest in 33 years and the prospect of them rising even higher are guaranteed by the fact that every single industrial sector in Japan is now short of labour. \nA deck of more than 60 slides further pointed to a market in rude health — the potential of which Japanese institutional and individual investors have still not recognised. Japanese investment trusts, pension funds and insurance companies, said Smith, hold respectively 26.9 per cent, 9.1 per cent and 6.1 per cent of their portfolios in equity. That compares with 61 per cent, 28.1 per cent and 11.1 per cent by their US equivalents.\nOver the past decades, the 12-month forward earnings per share of Topix stocks have (in local currency) outperformed peers in the US, Germany, China and the MSCI Emerging Market index. The profits of corporate Japan, Smith showed, are overwhelmingly correlated with global industrial production and world trade, rather than with US 10-year Treasury yields, the dollar-yen exchange rate or Japanese industrial production, as many imagine. \n“Every investor left the CLSA conference abundantly aware that corporate Japan sits, like the dragon Smaug, on a deep bed of unproductive gold,” said Smith. “As problems go, it’s a great problem to have.”  \nYou are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser.\nEven those who agree with that argument, however, see across-the-board gains as unlikely given the wide variations of quality among Japanese companies and the difficulty playing the Japanese market as stock selection becomes more critical to success.\n“The companies that have a more international mindset and understand how inflation works elsewhere will be the ones that are more able to adapt in contrast to those which are more reticent about raising pricing and cutting costs,” says Schroders’ MacLennan. “The risk is that, for those companies which are more slow to act, inflationary forces will be stronger than they will have prepared for,” he adds.\nJames Salter, founder of UK-based Zennor Asset Management and a veteran of Japanese markets, says the easy money has, at this point, already been made.\nThe problem is that the market is bifurcated, he adds. There is a very sharp difference between large-cap companies, such as Toyota, doing a lot for shareholders, and then lots of companies in the sub-$2bn market cap category that are not doing quite enough. Some of the strongest- performing Japanese stocks in the past year have been the five major Japanese trading houses, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Itochu, Marubeni and Sumitomo. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has become the largest shareholder of each. Although limited to just five stocks, the investment, Berkshire’s first in Japan, was widely seen as a huge endorsement of the Japanese market story, and continues to reverberate.\n“If you look back over a year and a half, and you bought the trading houses post Buffett, the automakers and the tech stocks related to AI like Tokyo Electron, you were where you wanted to be,” says Salter. “But if you go down the spectrum it’s more complicated and while delivery of shareholder returns has often been good, everything is still conservative on growth prospects.”\n",

        "Title": "Japan’s chip supply chain stocks are still a good way to tap AI trends",
        "Author": "ft",
        "Content": "Asia’s chip sector has been following Nvidia’s rally in the past year. But while the region’s largest AI and chipmaker stocks have continued to gain, companies further down the semiconductor supply chain, including suppliers of chipmaking equipment, chip materials and chemicals, have been lagging behind global peers in recent months. There is still plenty of room for upside.\nShares of chipmaking equipment manufacturer Tokyo Electron are down a tenth since early April. Local peer Towa is a tenth lower since last Thursday. Companies making machines that test and measure chips in the manufacturing process are also losing, with Advantest down a quarter since a March high. Shares of Screen, which makes wafer cleaning and etching materials for chip devices, have also fallen.\nPart of the reason is due to high earnings expectations for everything chip related. As several companies missed these optimistic estimates in the March quarter, a sell-off ensued. Another reason is steep valuations. Rapid gains before the recent sell-off pushed stocks such as Advantest to 48 times forward earnings, a premium of more than a third to global peers and more than double levels from early last year.\nOn top of global investor enthusiasm for AI-related companies, Japanese chip sector shares had also enjoyed an additional boost from foreign investor interest in the local equity market, after the Tokyo Stock Exchange called on companies to improve capital efficiency. This theme has pushed the broader benchmark Nikkei 225 index up 50 per cent since the start of last year, reaching a record high in February.\nAll of this, combined with weaker-than-expected demand and weaker prices of memory chips — a chip glut from last year drags on — has set the stage for a correction. But longer term, demand for chipmaking gear, semiconductor materials and testing devices should remain high as capital investment in servers is growing around the world. \nBusinesses involved in making silicon wafers and chemicals used in chip manufacturing and chip testing are sometimes overlooked by investors when compared with more glamorous businesses such as AI chip designers.\nYet one positive in favour of these suppliers is a lack of rivalry in the space. For example, just four local companies account for nearly three-quarters of the world’s supply of photoresist, a material used to add patterned coatings on the surface of silicon wafer during the chip manufacturing process. This should protect their healthy margins and provide a layer of protection against cyclical swings.\njune.yoon@ft.com\n",

        "Content": "Hi everyone! This is Lauly from Taipei.\nAs I was writing this newsletter, China unexpectedly announced the immediate start of military drills surrounding Taiwan, just days after the democratically ruled island’s new president, Lai Ching-te, was sworn in.\nLai, who is from the same China-sceptic Democratic Progressive party as his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen, is considered a “separatist” by Beijing. During his inauguration speech on Monday, he urged China to accept Taiwan’s existence.\nI actually got several texts from tech executives saying they sensed “firmness” in Lai’s speech and that they wondered how Beijing would react. Many of these suppliers already started to build capacity outside of Taiwan after China conducted live-fire military drills around Taiwan in the summer of 2022.\nAmid the geopolitical uncertainties, I can feel the excitement as the tech industry gears up for Computex, one of the most important tech fairs in Asia, in a couple of weeks. People are particularly excited because this will be the first time since Covid that Computex will host CEOs from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Qualcomm, Arm and more. Their key partners, including Quanta Computers, Pegatron, Asustek Computer and Acer, are also preparing big press events.\nThe key theme of the event will almost certainly be artificial intelligence. The tech supply chain has already witnessed exponential growth since last year driven by AI servers, thanks to the demand for generative AI. Nvidia on Wednesday reported another record revenue of $26bn. The PC industry is also excited about the potential for AI to reinvigorate the sector after it hit a slowdown in the second half of 2022.\nAI is also a potential blessing for Sharp. The Japanese electronics maker, a Foxconn affiliate, recently announced plans to stop production at its major display factory in Sakai, a seaside city in Osaka, and transform it into an AI data centre. A source close to Foxconn told me that the China-driven supply glut in the LCD display industry made it hard to turn the factory around.\n“However, the Sakai factory was designed with massive electricity supply given the display technology, plus it is located close to the sea, making the facility ideal to turn into an AI data centre, which is power-hungry and requires liquid-cooling measures,” the source said.\nTesla has asked suppliers to start making components and parts outside of both China and Taiwan by next year at the earliest to mitigate rising geopolitical risks, Nikkei Asia’s Lauly Li and Cheng Ting-Fang write.\nA variety of suppliers have received such requests, including makers of printed circuit boards, displays and electric control units, according to six supply chain executives with direct knowledge of the matter.\n“We got the request from Tesla that they hope to have components that are both OOC and OOT, meaning out of China and out of Taiwan,” a source from a Taiwan-based supplier to Tesla and others told Nikkei Asia. “They hope such a proposal can materialise from next year’s new projects.”\nThe requests came before Taiwan’s new president took office, and before the US announced sharply higher tariffs on Chinese EVs. For companies with supply chains touching Taiwan, China’s latest military drills around the island will only add to concerns over potential disruptions.\nChina’s artificial intelligence groups have found a new route to commercialise the technology by producing “AI-in-a-box” products for companies to run generative AI on their own premises.\nThe emerging trend is a threat to the AI cloud computing services offered by the country’s big tech groups such as Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, write Ryan McMorrow and Nian Liu for the Financial Times.\nIn the lead for “all-in-one” AI machines is national champion Huawei, which has signed up more than a dozen start-ups to bundle and market their large language models with its AI processors and other hardware. Its partners include groups such as Beijing-based Zhipu AI and language specialist iFlytek.\nChinese groups want the AI boxes to bring the advances of generative AI to on-premise, or private cloud, set-ups, which are seen as more secure and accounts for about half of the market.\nHuawei estimates the Chinese market for these machines will hit Rmb16.8bn ($2.3bn) this year. Analysts at Minsheng Securities forecast the government market for AI boxes could reach Rmb450bn by 2027.\nThailand’s industrial parks face an increasing risk of power supply shortages as a flurry of printed circuit board investments come online next year, writes Nikkei Asia’s Lauly Li. PCBs are the material on to which chips and components are mounted before being assembled into final products.\nThe south-east Asian country is a top choice for relocation of the PCBs away from China and Taiwan, according to the Taiwan Printed Circuit Association, a leading industry body that represents 700 PCB makers and their suppliers. Many of those investments are happening in clusters.\n“Take Prachinburi province, for example. There are 10 new PCB manufacturing facilities as well as four new materials and equipment suppliers’ factories,” TPCA Chairman Maurice Lee said. “We are concerned about the surge in demand for electricity and water when the new factories gradually run to full capacity.”\nSemiconductor Manufacturing International Co and ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT) — China’s top contract chipmaker and memory chipmaker — are gearing up to localise supplies of key chip materials and chemicals to counter continued US export controls, Nikkei Asia’s Cheng Ting-Fang reports.\nSMIC is asking the chip developers it serves to help it screen, verify and adopt local providers of wafers, chemicals, gases and other materials, while CXMT has started to vet local suppliers to replace foreign ones.\nThe latest localisation drive goes beyond efforts to use more domestic chipmaking equipment, a segment that was directly hit by tighter US regulations, and extends to the supply of hundreds of chemicals, materials and gases, potentially pushing foreign suppliers out of the market.\nJapanese chipmaker CEO on buyout bosses (FT)\nTemu parent PDD tops Alibaba’s market cap again on big earnings (Nikkei Asia)\nBaidu builds up ties with Apple and Tesla in diversification drive (Nikkei Asia)\nArup lost $25mn in Hong Kong deepfake video conference scam (FT)\nMicrosoft offers staff to relocate from China (FT)\nPanasonic to sell projector business to fill growth war chest (Nikkei Asia)\nSamsung replaces semiconductor chief as it chases AI chip rivals (FT)\nNvidia more than triples revenue as AI becomes the ‘new commodity’ (Nikkei Asia)\nChinese online shopping festival kicks off with steep Apple discounts (Nikkei Asia)\nDiDi co-founder steps down as president (FT)",

        "Content": "Samsung Electronics has replaced its semiconductor chief in an effort to overcome what it has described as a “chip crisis”, amid growing concern that the world’s largest memory-chip maker by sales is falling behind rivals in the booming artificial intelligence segment.\nThe South Korean company appointed Jun Young-hyun to head its core semiconductor business, replacing Kyung Kye-hyun, who will now lead Samsung’s “future business” division looking at different technologies. Jun previously led the group’s battery unit, Samsung SDI, and earlier worked in memory chip development.\nThe move comes as Samsung is trying to catch up with rivals in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in artificial intelligence, following criticism that it is trailing domestic rival SK Hynix in mass-producing the most advanced HBM chips.\n“This is a pre-emptive measure to strengthen future competitiveness by renewing the atmosphere internally and externally,” Samsung said on Tuesday, adding that Jun’s knowhow would help it overcome the “chip crisis”.\nAnalysts said the mid-year shake-up was out of the ordinary. Samsung usually changes its top executives at the end of the year. “It shows its sense of crisis or how desperate it is, as it is lagging behind its rivals in cutting-edge products like HBM and DDR5 [memory],” said an analyst at a foreign brokerage who did not wish to be named.\nSK Hynix shares have surged by more than a third this year, while Samsung shares are little changed despite a strong recovery in memory chip prices. Samsung is also struggling to catch up with bigger rival TSMC in the foundry business of contract-manufacturing chips.\nSK Hynix is currently the exclusive supplier of HBM3E chips for Nvidia’s graphics processing units needed for training AI. In March, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang said his company was in the process of qualifying Samsung’s new HBM chips for its GPUs.\nSamsung is optimistic about AI demand in the second half and plans to triple HBM supply this year. It recently began mass production of its latest HBM product, eight-layer HBM3E chips, and plans to mass produce 12-layer HBM chips by the end of June — a quarter earlier than SK Hynix.\nRecommended\nKwon Jae-soon, the head of yield at SK Hynix, told the Financial Times that it had been able to reduce the time needed to bring into production its HBM3E chips by 50 per cent. A target yield rate of 80 per cent of chips being made without imperfections had almost been reached for the latest HBM chips, he added.\nThe chipmaker’s HBM production capacity is almost fully booked through next year. SK Hynix plans to mass produce more advanced HBM4 chips in collaboration with TSMC in 2025, a year earlier than Samsung.\n“Our main focus this year is on producing eight-layer HBM3Es because that’s what customers want most,” said Kwon. “Boosting yields is getting more important to stay ahead in this AI era.”",

        "Content": "Masayoshi Son has earned some leeway for bold bets on artificial intelligence. Having Arm under his wing, which helped Son’s SoftBank Group to a second consecutive quarter of profitability, could even lower the risk of failed bets. \nAfter years of haphazard technology bets around the globe, Son’s shift to a more conservative stance has paid off. The Tokyo-based group managed a net profit of ¥231bn ($1.5bn) in the quarter to March despite its Vision Fund reporting a loss. A large number of lossmaking start-ups in its second Vision Fund have weighed on group earnings in recent years. Indeed, SoftBank still posted an annual loss for the third consecutive year.\nSoftBank has been a beneficiary of the weaker yen, as it invests in US companies. One of the best performing is food delivery group DoorDash, whose shares are up nearly 75 per cent in the past year.\nBut the key boost comes from Arm, whose shares are up more than 70 per cent since its US listing. SoftBank owns about 90 per cent of the UK-based chip designer, which now has a valuation of more than $110bn. Arm was the main reason for a 45 per cent increase in SoftBank’s net asset value to a record high of Y27.8tn. It accounts for nearly half of the total in terms of asset composition.\nImproving earnings means SoftBank was sitting on a cash pile of ¥6.2tn at the end of March. Son has been doubling down on investments in AI and chip-related themes, with SoftBank leading a $1.05bn funding round for UK self-driving start-up Wayve Technologies last week. It is reported to be in talks to acquire British semiconductor start-up Graphcore. Arm is also looking to develop its own chips, setting up an AI chip division to build a prototype.\nMaking progress here while maintaining its biggest strength — customer neutrality — will be a difficult balance to strike. Development costs will be high. While Arm has decades of experience in chip design and dominates in the area of central processing unit cores for mobile devices, catching up with the likes of Nvidia on designs for the graphics processing units used in data centres and AI is another task altogether. \nThe risk of overpaying for investments into AI start-ups this year, at today’s lofty valuations, is also substantial. It has only been a year since SoftBank posted record annual investment losses of ¥5.3tn in its tech-heavy Vision funds\nThis time, at the very least, Son’s investments have a common theme. The next step for Son will be figuring out a way — credibly — to get Arm involved.\njune.yoon@ft.com",

        "Content": "Hay Festival has suspended its sponsorship from Baillie Gifford, after boycotts from speakers and performers over the Edinburgh-based asset manager’s purported links to Israel and the fossil fuel industry. \nJulie Finch, chief executive of the Hay, said on Friday that the book festival’s decision to drop its principal sponsor was taken “in light of claims raised by campaigners and intense pressure on artists to withdraw”.\nBaillie Gifford is a prominent patron of the arts and provides backing for many of the UK’s leading literary festivals — including the Edinburgh International Book Festival, the Boswell Book Festival and the Wigtown Book Festival — as well as the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction. Its annual sponsorship of Hay is around £130,000, according to a person familiar with the situation.\nThe £225bn privately owned asset manager is also a long-standing investor in companies seeking to drive the transition to clean energy and holds large positions in the likes of electric-car maker Tesla and Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt.\nBut in the past year or so it has found itself caught in the line of fire of climate activists. Greta Thunberg pulled out of the Edinburgh event last August over its sponsorship by Baillie Gifford, accusing the asset manager of greenwashing, prompting some authors to follow suit.\nEarlier this month an open letter from lobby group Fossil Free Books called on Baillie Gifford to “divest from the fossil fuel industry and from companies that profit from Israeli apartheid, occupation and genocide”.\nThe 11-day festival began in the Welsh town of Hay-on-Wye on Thursday and speakers including Charlotte Church, comedian Nish Kumar, Labour MP Dawn Butler, Labour peer Baroness Shami Chakrabarti and economics author Grace Blakeley have pulled out over Baillie Gifford’s investments.\n“Our first priority is to our audience and our artists,” said Finch. “We must preserve the freedom of our stages and spaces for open debate and discussion, where audiences can hear a range of perspectives.”\nIn a clip posted by the festival, commentator George Monbiot said he had decided to press on with his session on Thursday because Hay is “a good cause” and “because this thing that we’re protesting against, we are all deeply embedded in”.“We can’t just point to one instance of this Earth-eating, people-eating system and say, ‘That and that alone is a problem’. We have to deal with the whole thing,” he told the audience.\nBaillie Gifford said it was “regrettable our sponsorship with [Hay] festival cannot continue” and rejected the activists’ claims. It said that the suggestion that Baillie Gifford is a large investor in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is “seriously misleading” and conflates two different types of exposure. \nWhile Baillie Gifford was a large investor in several multinational technology companies, including Amazon, chipmaker Nvidia and Facebook owner Meta, “their commercial dealings with the State of Israel are tiny in the context of their overall business” and “these companies have not violated any laws”, the statement said. \nIt added that the asset manager was a minor shareholder in multinational companies — Airbnb, Booking Holdings and Cemex — “that have been identified as having problematic operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories”. It noted that in all three cases, “these operations are small in the context of their overall business” and said that “in the absence of international sanctions, they have been forced to adapt their approaches owing to a complex array of legislation that penalises and prohibits actions that would constitute a boycott of Israel”.\nBaillie Gifford reiterated that it was “not a significant fossil fuel investor”, pointing out that only 2 per cent of its clients’ money is invested in companies with some business related to fossil fuels, compared with the market average of 11 per cent. \n",

        "Title": "Nvidia unveils next generation of AI chips in bid to entrench market lead",
        "Author": "Eleanor Olcott in Taipei, Tim Bradshaw in London and Michael Acton in San Francisco ",
        "Content": "Nvidia announced the next generation of its artificial intelligence processors on Sunday in a surprise move less than three months after its most recent launch. \nAt the Computex conference in Taipei, the chipmaker’s chief executive Jensen Huang unveiled “Rubin”, the successor to its “Blackwell” chips for data centres, which are currently in production after being announced in March. \nThe unexpected move to reveal its next wave of products before Blackwell has even started shipping to customers shows how the world’s most valuable chipmaker is racing to entrench its dominance of AI processors, which has propelled it into the ranks of the world’s most valuable companies. \n“A new computing age is starting,” Huang said, as Nvidia also unveiled new AI chip deals with PC makers. \nRubin is set to start shipping in 2026 and promises improved power efficiency, as the Silicon Valley-based company attempts to address concerns that Big Tech’s expansion of AI data centres is putting strain on the energy grid in some regions. \nThe announcement was light on detail but Huang said Nvidia was working on a “one-year rhythm” of building new AI platforms. \nNvidia’s pace of innovation has taken on outsized importance to the wider stock market, as traders bet on whether the huge AI-driven rally in a handful of Big Tech companies can continue. \nThe chipmaker added about $350bn to its market capitalisation after it reported surging revenue growth, and the company is closing in on Apple to become the second most valuable US company after Microsoft. \nWhile Nvidia today sells the majority of the AI chips needed to train large language models, such as OpenAI’s GPT, the company faces growing competition from AMD and Intel, as well as bespoke chips developed by cloud computing providers including Amazon, Google and Microsoft. \nNvidia’s Blackwell chip is being rolled out barely a year after its current generation “Hopper” chips were unveiled. \nThe company on Sunday also announced a new Vera Arm-based central processing unit, as Nvidia seeks to make more of the chips that go into AI data centres.\nCPUs, a market dominated by Intel and AMD, are traditionally the workhorse of any computer but Huang is attempting to reshape the server market around its AI chips, as artificial intelligence takes a growing share of data centre workloads. \nNvidia started out more than 30 years ago making graphics processing units, which acted as a sidekick to Intel CPUs in video gaming PCs. But more than 15 years ago, Huang realised that the technology inside its GPUs was also suited to other data intensive computing tasks, such as AI. \nThe company is now trying to boost its PC chip business by capitalising on its dominance in AI chips for data centres. \nHuang on Sunday also announced deals with two PC makers, Asus and MSI, that will launch machines using Nvidia’s GeForce RTX graphics processing units to support a range of AI tasks, from running digital assistants to video editing and coding. \n“Your future laptop will be constantly helping you in the background,” Huang said. “The PC will run apps that are enhanced by AI, from writing, photo editing, to digital humans that are AIs,” said Huang. \nNvidia did not specify when the Asus and MSI laptops will go on sale.\nA range of PC makers and component providers are expected to use the Computex event to make announcements to position themselves as beneficiaries of an expected “AI PC” wave.\nRecommended\nMicrosoft recently unveiled a string of AI-enhanced PCs and tablets fitted out with its Copilot assistant tool, powered by Qualcomm’s chips, which will begin to launch later this month. Microsoft has said it expects to include the Nvidia chips and AMD’s Radeon graphics chips in its PCs in future. \nPC sales have slumped since the pandemic but analysts expect that when demand revives companies will increasingly opt for AI PCs embedded with powerful chips to run AI applications, rather than relying solely on the cloud.\n“AI PCs will bring the most exciting innovation to the PC industry in the last two to three decades, since the creation of the World Wide Web in the late 1980s,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note last month.\nThey said that running AI applications on devices would be cheaper and more flexible than on the cloud and would also have benefits for data privacy. AI PCs will make up about 65 per cent of PC shipments by 2028, up from 2 per cent this year, Morgan Stanley predicted.",

        "Title": "Nvidia market cap jumps by $350bn amid ‘gamma squeeze’ ",
        "Author": "George Steer in London",
        "Content": "Nvidia has gained $350bn in market value in wildly volatile trading since it reported first-quarter earnings just over a week ago, driven in part by a feedback loop of trading in the chipmaker’s huge options market. \nThe company was valued at $2.69tn by Friday’s close, more than JPMorgan, Berkshire Hathaway and Meta combined, despite a pullback at the end of the week. It has added roughly $350bn since May 23, when it announced surging revenue growth over the first three months of the year. At the peak earlier in the week its value had risen by nearly half a trillion dollars, growing by a sum close to the market capitalisation of Tesla in just a few days.\nAlthough many investors have been drawn to Nvidia by its bumper earnings, analysts say the past week’s rally bears the hallmarks of a so-called “gamma squeeze”. In such a market phenomenon, bulk buying of call options — derivatives that give traders the right to buy at a preset price and which can pay off it a stock rises — forces brokers on the other side of the trade to buy shares in the underlying stock to protect themselves.\nAs Nvidia’s share price climbed this week, bullish traders purchased more and more call options, forcing brokers to purchase further Nvidia shares. This pushes the company’s share price higher, boosting demand for calls, all of which drives a self-fuelling cycle of further dealer hedging. \n“Nvidia has become a one-way wrecking machine,” said Charlie McElligott, an equity derivatives strategist at Nomura. Dealers who sold call options are having “to go out and buy Nvidia to stay hedged into the rally”.\nShares closed down 0.8 per cent on Friday, but the chipmaker has nevertheless dramatically closed the gap with Apple and Microsoft, for a long time the two largest companies on US markets.\nGamma squeezes “need a trigger”, said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “An earnings beat, raised guidance and a stock split . . . are all potential triggers,” he added, referring to a 10-for-1 stock split that Nvidia announced along with its earnings.\nSuch squeezes are not uncommon. The meme-stock rally of early 2021 that centred on video game retailer GameStop was another example of traders buying short-dated, out-of-the-money call options that forced brokers to snap up the company’s shares, driving a huge, if shortlived, rally. \nUnlike GameStop, Nvidia boasts profit margins above 50 per cent and has lately come to embody investors’ hopes about the potentially transformative effect on the global economy of generative artificial intelligence, a technology that runs on the company’s chips. \nEven investors who think Nvidia’s rally may have gone too far have found the stock hard to ignore. “If you were designing a perfect momentum stock, Nvidia would be it,” said Aswath Damodaran, a New York University professor and expert on equity valuation, referring to companies that are borne upwards by their own past performance. \nExcitement around generative AI and the Nvidia chips that underpin it has intensified to such a degree that “when Microsoft announces a huge capex [capital expenditure] spend [with] Nvidia the recipient of that capex spend, both stocks rally endlessly on the same news,” said Ritholtz Wealth Management chief executive Josh Brown in a note to clients this week. \n“It’s a carousel that feeds on its own momentum and everyone’s having the time of their life. Until one of that carousel’s ponies stumbles. Or some CFO somewhere looks at the spending, compares it to the actual return on investment, and decides to slow things up,” Brown added. ",

        "Author": "ft",
        "Content": "The US restaurant industry has had a rough start to 2024. Sales and footfall are sliding as customers pull back their spending. Price increases can no longer be relied on to pick up the slack. KFC owner Yum Brands and Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants are among the big chains that reported a drop in same-store sales in their most recent quarter. At McDonald’s, growth on the same metric has fallen for four straight quarters. Elsewhere, Red Lobster, the debt-laden seafood chain, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this month.\nYet there has been one bright spot: “fast-casual” chains. These pitch themselves as a healthier option, or cater to a slightly better-off customer than their fast-food rivals.\nThis focus has helped salad purveyor Sweetgreen, burrito hawker Chipotle and burger slinger Shake Shack to buck the wider gloom to report higher like-for-like sales last quarter. \nShares in these companies have in turn served up market-beating returns. Sweetgreen is up more than 190 per cent this year, topping even tech darling Nvidia’s gains. Cava, a Mediterranean-inspired eatery that went public last June, has doubled in value. Chipotle is up about 40 per cent over the period, compared with a decline of 13 per cent for McDonald’s.\nSeveral factors are driving the divergence in performance. Fast casuals’ higher-income customers have helped shield the chains from the worst of the reduction in consumer spending, which has hit the less well-off the most. \nFast food is also no longer a bargain. Inflation and new minimum wage laws in states such as California have forced the likes of McDonald’s to raise prices. In New York City, a Big Mac meal plus tax now tops $12. Suddenly, the $13 carnitas rice bowl from Chipotle or an $18 salad from Sweetgreen does not look so expensive. The average cost of lunch at a fast-casual restaurant was only $2.64 more compared to one at a fast-food restaurant in the first quarter of 2024, according to consumer consultancy Circana.\nFast-casual chains may be in a sweet spot but their valuations are starting to look spicy. Sweetgreen, which has yet to make an annual profit, is now trading on six times revenues, compared with its 12-month average of about three times. Cava, which swung into an annual profit in 2023, is trading at 12 times revenue, also well ahead of its 12-month average of eight times. That makes it hard for investors to justify adding second helpings to their plates, especially if fast-food operators start cutting prices again.\npan.yuk@ft.com",

        "Author": "Tim Bradshaw in London",
        "Content": "Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence start-up xAI has closed a $6bn funding round at a valuation of $18bn, as investor fervour for new challengers to OpenAI continues unabated. \nDespite being little more than a year old, xAI’s financing vaults it into the richest tier of potential rivals to Microsoft-backed OpenAI, which has secured more than $13bn in funding. Measured by capital raised, xAI now ranks alongside Anthropic, which has raised more than $8bn since it was established in 2021. \nMusk was a co-founder of OpenAI before he split with its chief executive Sam Altman in 2018.\nInvestors in xAI’s new round include many of Musk’s most loyal backers, including Kingdom Holding, the Saudi investor led by Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, Valor Equity Partners, and Dubai-based Vy Capital, as well as Silicon Valley firms Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. \nThe same investors had previously backed Musk’s $44bn acquisition of Twitter in 2022. The AI start-up’s chatbot Grok is tightly integrated with Musk’s social media platform, now called X, giving it access to a real-time stream of data and a large audience of potential users. \nAssembling the talent and computing power needed to build large AI models comes with a high price tag. Nvidia, the dominant supplier of the chips needed to train AI systems, last week reported a 262 per cent jump in revenue as demand continues to outstrip the supply of its latest processors. The world’s most valuable companies — including Microsoft, Google and Meta — are all racing to expand their AI capabilities and investing billions in the data centre infrastructure needed to build and run them. \nNonetheless, investors still see opportunities for new entrants and alternative approaches to building large language models, the AI systems that power Grok and ChatGPT. The xAI deal comes as Paris-based Mistral, which was founded a year ago, closes in on a new €500mn round at €5bn valuation, according to people familiar with the talks. \nThe deal gives xAI a so-called post-money valuation of $24bn once the new investment is taken into account. \nThe company said it had “made significant strides” in a short time, including adding image capabilities to Grok, which was released in November.\n“xAI will continue on this steep trajectory of progress over the coming months, with multiple exciting technology updates and products soon to be announced,” it said in a blog post late on Sunday evening in California. “The funds from the round will be used to take xAI’s first products to market, build advanced infrastructure, and accelerate the research and development of future technologies.” \nIt added: “The company’s mission is to understand the true nature of the universe.”\nMusk has pitched Grok as a “maximum truth-seeking” alternative to what he has sought to portray as “politically correct” rivals ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. \nDuring its fundraising, backers of Musk’s other ventures, including X and SpaceX, were given first refusal to back xAI, people familiar with the talks told the Financial Times last week. \nInvestors who had raised questions about issues at Musk’s other ventures had been frozen out of the xAI funding round, said one person who participated. \nThe FT first reported in January that xAI was in talks to raise as much as $6bn. At the time, Musk said in a post on X: “xAI is not raising capital and I have had no conversations with anyone in this regard.”",

        "Content": "US stocks reversed early gains, as signs of an uptick in business activity in the world’s biggest economy countered another set of blockbuster results from chipmaker Nvidia.\nWall Street’s S&P 500 closed 0.7 per cent lower in New York on Thursday, having made small gains to reach a record intraday high earlier in the session. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.4 per cent, also retracing an earlier advance.\nThe reversal followed early or “flash” indices from S&P Global showing signs of acceleration in manufacturing and services industries in the US economy, with a composite index reading coming in at 54.4 for May. That was higher than consensus forecasts of 51.1 and above April’s reading of 51.3. Any figure above 50 signals expansion.\nJobs data released earlier on Thursday showed initial applications for US unemployment fell by 8,000 to 215,000 for the week ending May 18, versus a Reuters consensus estimate of 220,000.\nThe figures — although better than expected — suggest the labour market remains relatively tight, and sparked a sell-off in US government debt. Yields on interest rate-sensitive two-year Treasuries was up 0.06 percentage points to 4.94 per cent.\nInvestors have been scrutinising labour market and business survey data for clues about the strength of the US economy, with signs of resilience typically weighing on bets about the probability of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year.\nAs of Thursday afternoon, just one quarter-point rate cut was fully priced in for 2024, in December.\nThe minutes of the May 1 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which were released on Wednesday, revealed US officials would be ready to raise interest rates if inflation began to creep higher again.\n“The fact that Fed minutes showed a hypothetical openness to hiking rates again, should inflation remain too high, was a bit of a wake-up call,” said Mike Zigmont, head of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management. \nKristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, said the FOMC minutes “threw some cold water” on Wall Street on Wednesday, only for that to be countered by the strong Nvidia results. \n“But that was shortlived,” she said, with Thursday’s data serving as a reminder of the hawkishness of the Fed minutes. “I’m not surprised by the reversal . . . It is to be expected given the data. But I am confident the disinflationary process is continuing. No matter how hawkish Fed rhetoric gets, I am still confident the Fed will cut this year.”\nElsewhere, Nvidia shares closed more than 9 per cent higher after the chipmaker announced late on Wednesday stronger than expected earnings, a 10-for-1 stock split and bullish forward guidance.\nNvidia’s update helped push its market value above $2.5tn for the first time.\nInvestors closely watch Nvidia as the company — now a stock market heavyweight — has repeatedly blown past analysts’ revenue and margin forecasts and emerged as the dominant provider of the graphics processing units that power generative artificial intelligence.\nThe tech giant’s results on Wednesday were “perfect”, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer at Bank Syz. “There was a lot of hype ahead of earnings and the stock price has already doubled since the start of the year [but] they managed to beat by all counts,” he added.",

        "Author": "Michael Acton in San Francisco",
        "Content": "Record sales of artificial intelligence chips sent Nvidia’s revenue soaring 262 per cent in the past quarter, beating lofty expectations, and its chief executive said its blockbuster growth was set to continue this year with the launch of a new line of chips. \nJensen Huang told investors the company would see “a lot” of revenue from its new Blackwell chips this year as it profits from exploding demand for the computing power behind generative AI.\nBlackwell will contribute to a new phase of growth for the company, Huang said, adding that Nvidia would continue rolling out newer, more powerful chips at the same pace. “After Blackwell, there’s another chip, and we are on a one-year rhythm,” he said.\nDemand for Nvidia’s AI data centre graphics processing units has skyrocketed in the past year as the biggest tech companies rush to develop the computing infrastructure needed to deliver powerful new AI products at scale. Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon have all indicated that their spending would remain high throughout 2024.\nRevenue for the three months to the end of April was $26bn versus consensus estimates of $24.7bn. The enormous year-on-year increase was similar to the previous quarter, when growth hit 265 per cent. For the current quarter Nvidia expects revenue of about $28bn, plus or minus 2 per cent, compared with consensus estimates of $26.8bn. \nYou are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser.\nNvidia’s data centre revenue, which relates to its coveted AI chips, was up 427 per cent year on year for the quarter to $22.6bn, driven by strong demand for Nvidia’s current generation Hopper GPUs, Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress told investors. Shipments of the Blackwell chip are expected to start this quarter.\nNvidia shares were 8.3 per cent higher in early trading on Thursday, meaning they have more than doubled in value during a blistering rally this year. The chipmaker also announced a 10-for-1 stock split effective from June 7 and said it was raising its quarterly cash dividend 150 per cent.\nAhead of the results announcement, traders were bracing for big swings in Nvidia shares and markets more broadly. The stock’s massive rally has made it one of the most closely watched names on Wall Street. Since the start of 2023 its market capitalisation has increased more than six-fold to $2.3tn, overtaking Google parent Alphabet and Amazon to become the third-most valuable US-listed company.\nNvidia has been moving quickly to capitalise on the surge of demand for AI and stay ahead of competitors and customers that are developing their own AI chips. It revealed its Blackwell chips in March, which it says are twice as powerful as the current generation of chips for training AI models and offer five times the performance on “inference” — the speed at which such models can respond to queries. That came just a year after the company revealed its previous generation of GPU chip architecture, Hopper.\nAnalysts had questioned whether the transition to a new product line could affect the massive year-on-year growth that Nvidia recorded in previous quarters, as a temporary “air pocket” in demand emerges. The rapid pace of its chip releases has, for example, led Amazon to change plans to order chips based on the last generation of Nvidia’s architecture and replace them with the Blackwell line.\nBut Huang reassured investors that demand for both the Hopper and Blackwell lines was “way ahead of supply”, a situation that would probably continue “well into next year”.\nDiluted earnings per share were $5.98, up more than 600 per cent from a year ago. Gross margin was 78.4 per cent, slightly better than the 77 per cent analysts had predicted, with net income at $14.9bn, ahead of expectations for $13.2bn.\nRivals AMD and Intel have been rolling out AI data centre chips to compete with Nvidia’s, as well as joining forces with Nvidia’s clients to offer alternatives to its software platform, Cuda, which cements its dominance as a chip supplier.\nIn April, Intel and AMD announced lacklustre first-quarter results and modest guidance, suggesting they are yet to reap the benefits of the explosion in demand. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced it would be using AMD’s new MI300X accelerator chips and its ROCm software to run some of the most demanding AI workloads on its Azure cloud service.\n“Nvidia beat on the data centre [revenue] and beat across the board,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive of The Futurum Group. “The whole market was waiting for this number and Nvidia delivered.”\nThe stock split would create “more accessibility” as well as “additional momentum for the stock”, he added. “The AI trade is alive and well.”",

        "Author": "Sujeet Indap",
        "Content": "Good morning, Sujeet Indap here and excited to fill in for Rob today.\nYesterday, Nvidia produced its usual blowout quarter: Revenues up 262 per cent year on year, $26bn in total for the first three months of the fiscal year, ending April. \nMost interestingly, the company will split its shares 10 to 1 in order to “make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors” (it’s share price is about to touch $1,000, roughly doubling so far in 2024). Such pie-splitting exercises should not create shareholder value, but these days just about anything can send Nvidia’s stock price off to the races.\nThe collapse this week of Red Lobster has understandably been focused on its sharpest hook: a $20 all-you-can-eat shrimp promotion (known as “Ultimate Endless Shrimp”) that allegedly benefited its primary shellfish vendor, Thai Union, which happened to be its largest equity shareholder.\nBut the Red Lobster saga really traces back a decade to one of the most sensational boardroom showdowns of recent memory. Red Lobster was then part of Darden Restaurants, whose biggest banner is the hokey Italian chain Olive Garden. The activist hedge fund Starboard Value had by early 2014 taken a 6 per cent stake in Darden, arguing that the incumbent management were the wrong chefs in the kitchen. \nIn the midst of the months-long proxy fight, Darden sold off Red Lobster for $2.1bn in cash to the private equity firm Golden Gate Capital, a decision and deal price that inflamed both the already furious Starboard and essentially every other big shareholder. \nIn October 2014, Starboard managed to defeat the entire 12-person Darden board, an almost unprecedented corporate governance rout at a Fortune 500 company.\nDarden, which today operates such brands as Cheddar’s, Capital Grille and Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse, has subsequently thrived, at least for shareholders. Since the beginning of 2014, around when Starboard started making noise, Darden shares have almost tripled, in line with the S&P 500 but well ahead of arch-rivals Brinker (Chili’s) and Bloomin’ Brands (Outback Steakhouse).\nAt the peak of its campaign, Starboard shared a 294-page PowerPoint presentation listing its grievances and turnaround plan that itself would become legendary. Its suggestions included specific operating improvements for Olive Garden processes in such areas as boiling fettuccine and allocating breadstick capital.\nBut perhaps its most substantive idea pertained to real estate. Olive Garden and Red Lobster owned most of its land and buildings. And in the low-interest rate environment, Starboard saw an arbitrage opportunity in exploiting what it described as Darden’s embedded “rent subsidy”.\nIn 2015, after seizing control of the board, Starboard-led Darden spun off most of its properties — more than 400 — into a real estate investment trust, a listed company that would act as the operating company’s landlord. REITs do not pay federal income tax as long as they distribute nearly all of their cash flow to shareholders. \nAnd while Darden shares themselves are up 190 per cent in a decade, Darden plus the pro rata portion of Four Corners Property Trust is up 205 per cent. (Also: Darden and FCPT pay significant dividends so the combined total return is even higher.) The combined market cap of the pair today is $21bn.\nStarboard was furious that Darden’s previous management tossed Red Lobster overboard before the hedge fund could get its hand on its land, buildings and operations. But Red Lobster’s current predicament may have stemmed from how its real estate was harvested over the years.\nAccording to bankruptcy court filings, Red Lobster has only $300mn of traditional funded debt against annual revenues of $2bn. Reduced traffic along with higher operating costs have led to ebitda falling by 60 per cent and the resulting liquidity crunch. A year ago, it had $100mn of cash, which has today dwindled to less than $15mn. \nAnd then there is the matter of its lease payments owed to landlords. Court filings said that it owes a whopping $190.5mn annually in lease payments.\nA few months after acquiring Red Lobster for $2.1bn in 2014, Golden Gate immediately sold the bulk of its underlying property to a Reit called American Realty Capital Partners for $1.5bn. In 2016, Golden Gate sold a 49 per cent equity stake in Red Lobster to Thai Union for $575mn, terms that valued the entire Red Lobster equity at nearly $1.2bn. \nGolden Gate completely sold out of Red Lobster in 2020 at an undisclosed price. But just based on these public figures, Golden Gate’s equity returns seem substantial.\nGolden Gate’s equity returns are then Red Lobster’s thin margin for error. Creditors led by Fortress Investment Group are expected to take control of the company and use the Chapter 11 process to shed bad leases and reorganise into a slimmer company.\nOne thing that struck Unhedged is how Darden, as a public company, managed its balance sheet seemingly far more conservatively than the privately owned Red Lobster.\nHere are the leverage ratios that Darden disclosed in its annual filings:\nDarden’s overall ratios of lease-adjusted debt to book capital have not moved much in the past decade even as lease expense owed to the Four Corners Reit have obviously jumped. Essentially, the company reduced loan and bond debt with cash flow and swapped in the lease debt that underlies the Reit.  \nThese “opco-propco” financial engineering gambits are understandably controversial for the added permanent risk that they create by separating the real estate. Either activist hedge funds or private equity firms have finite horizons and will aggressively take profits, leaving everyone else to be potential bagholders.\nAs for Red Lobster, the bankruptcy is a chance to reset and there is at least one person out there feeling optimism. Sumit Roy, the CEO of Realty Income, which is the Reit landlord for more than 200 Red Lobster locations, offered this assessment recently on an earnings call:\nI think of Red Lobster as a — it’s a pretty strange story. They have 700 unique locations. They garner 14% of the casual seafood concept. That is a very hard thing to do. And the fact that they generate north of $2 billion in revenue, if you look at it on a per unit basis, that’s just right around $3.5 million per unit. So it’s not a top-line issue as much as it is an operations issue. They’ve gone through several changes in terms of ownership. Obviously, there have been several changes in terms of management. And this is a business that, in our opinion, hasn’t been very well run.\nIf you look at the balance sheet, is it a balance sheet issue at Red Lobster? In our opinion, it’s not. They have [$300]mn of debt. And this is really a question of, is there an operator out there that could come in and basically manage this business even to a reasonable level of margins? Today, I don’t believe they’re generating a whole lot of ebitda.\nAnd so if this can be operationally right sized, we believe that this is a concept that should come out and should survive and do quite well given the footprint that they’ve been able to establish.\nGet in touch at sujeet.indap@ft.com and tell me what your favourite chain restaurant is.\nPrivate equity and the carceral-industrial complex",

        "Title": "Traders brace for big swings in Nvidia shares",
        "Author": "George Steer in London",
        "Content": "Traders are bracing for big swings in Nvidia’s share price and wider financial markets when the chipmaking giant reports first-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\nOptions activity surrounding the stock has mushroomed amid a ferocious rally that has seen Nvidia’s market cap increase more than six-fold to $2.3tn since the start of 2023, as the chipmaker has emerged as the go-to manufacturer of the graphics processing units that power generative AI.\nCurrent premiums in options markets imply that traders are anticipating an 8.6 per cent swing in the share price in either direction — equivalent to a market gain or loss of more than $180bn — when markets open on Thursday after the company publishes its latest results, according to Bloomberg data.\nThe combination of Nvidia’s enormous size and the volatility of its stock has given the company outsize importance in determining the mood and direction of the wider market, analysts say. \n“It’s Nvidia’s market, we’re all just trading in it,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “If it even hints [at a slowdown], that would be very damaging for the whole market.”\nNvidia’s earnings have recently become market-moving events. Analysts at JPMorgan this week ranked an Nvidia earnings miss behind only “recessionary or stagflationary” economic data and “extreme” investor positioning in a list of potential scenarios that could drag the US stock market meaningfully lower.\nSome of the stock’s biggest moves had come after the company reported results. Nvidia’s share price rose 24.4 per cent in the session after its earnings release last May, by 16.4 per cent in February and by 14 per cent after its results a year before. \nCharlie McElligott, managing director of cross-asset strategy at Nomura, said a good set of results for Nvidia could prove as beneficial for equity markets as benign inflation numbers. Both would “re-engage euphoria”, McElligott wrote in a note to clients last week.\nNvidia’s huge market clout means its impact is felt beyond the US equity market. \nMetals traders will be paying “a tremendous amount of attention” to the company’s results, said Al Munro, a broker at Marex. \nOne emerging market bond trader at a large US bank said Nvidia earnings had in the past moved prices of African sovereign debt. When the stock rallies, “it moves the whole market and risk sentiment everywhere improves”, the person said. \nTraders are drawn to Nvidia by its volatility — or “implied beta”, in the jargon. The S&P 500, in contrast, has for months been unusually calm.\nBy dollar value, Nvidia options now regularly account for almost one-third of all US options tied to a single company, and on some days accounted for closer to half, according to data gathered by research group Asym500. In the first quarter, its $115bn average notional option volume was more than double second-place Tesla’s.\nNvidia’s shares “are expensive and volatile, but the options are liquid. Those are the exact things you want to see as an options trader,” Sosnick said.\nSince the AI boom began in 2023, Nvidia’s implied beta has typically ranged between 3 and 4, indicating that for every 1 per cent move in the S&P 500, Nvidia will rise or fall by as much as 4 per cent. This makes it one of the highest beta securities in the US, according to Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics.\nRecommended\nIn recent days, options traders appear to have become more bullish about Nvidia’s upcoming results. Bloomberg data shows there has been an increase in purchases of calls — which confer the right to buy a stock at an agreed price — with a $1,000 strike price, a large premium to Nvidia’s current share price of $947.\nThat was reinforced by three Wall Street groups — Stifel, Susquehanna and Barclays — all upgrading their target forecasts days before the results.\nYet many of the world’s largest investors appear to have erred on the side of caution. Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne family office slashed its Nvidia exposure by 72 per cent in the first quarter and Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management cut its position in February.\nHedge funds including Coatue Management, DE Shaw, Citadel Advisors, Two Sigma, Renaissance Technologies and Millennium also took some profit during the first three months of the year, according to filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission last week.",

        "Title": "Amazon changes plans to order Nvidia ‘superchip’ to await updated model",
        "Author": "Camilla Hodgson and Tim Bradshaw in London and Michael Acton in San Francisco ",
        "Content": "Amazon’s cloud computing arm has changed its plans to use Nvidia’s most advanced “superchip” to wait for a more powerful new model, as investors fret about a dip in demand between the $2.3tn chipmaker’s product cycles. \nThe Silicon Valley-based chipmaker unveiled a new generation of processors dubbed Blackwell in March, barely a year after its predecessor Hopper began to be shipped to customers. Nvidia’s chief executive Jensen Huang said the new products would be twice as powerful for training large language models, the technology behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT. \nAmazon Web Services, the world’s largest cloud computing provider, told the Financial Times that it had “fully transitioned” from a plan to use Nvidia’s Grace Hopper superchip, which was launched in August, in favour of its successor Grace Blackwell. \nThe company said the move “made sense” given “that the window between Grace Hopper and Grace Blackwell was small”. \nNvidia declined to comment ahead of its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday, citing quiet period rules. \nAnalysts expect the chipmaker to report that sales tripled in its most recent quarter, driven by a frenzy of spending by Big Tech companies on artificial intelligence technology. But some investors have begun to question how long it can maintain its extraordinary growth streak. \nWhile Big Tech companies have pledged to continue to invest tens of billions of dollars into building out data centre infrastructure for AI this year, “there is anxiety [on Wall Street] about a pause in front of Blackwell”, analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients this week. \nRecommended\nProduction of the new Blackwell chips will ramp up over the course of this year. Analysts expect them to be delivered in the fourth quarter. In the interim, analysts at Citi pointed to a “potential air pocket” in demand for AI chips, after last year’s long wait times for Nvidia’s chips dissipated. \nChips based on Nvidia’s Hopper architecture, such as its sought-after H100 graphics processing units, went into full production in September 2022. The Grace Hopper superchip, also known as GH200, packages several H100 GPUs alongside high-speed memory, connectivity and a central processing unit. \nIts successor, the GB200, is the first product to take advantage of Blackwell. \nNeither Amazon nor Nvidia would confirm the value of the future order. Analysts at HSBC have estimated a GB200 chip, which includes two B100 chips, will cost as much as $70,000, with the price of an entire server carrying the new technology running up to $3mn.\nAWS continues to offer other Nvidia chips including H100s to its cloud customers. But, as one of Nvidia’s largest customers, the AWS move is likely to concern investors already worried that tech companies would delay purchases as they await Blackwell’s release. \nFor much of last year, demand for Nvidia’s H100 chips vastly outstripped supply as the launch of OpenAI’s breakthrough ChatGPT triggered a wave of investment in AI infrastructure by cloud and internet companies, start-ups and corporate buyers. \nBut since the start of 2024, the long waits for delivery of H100 chips have eased. \nAlthough Nvidia’s stock has almost doubled in value since the beginning of the year on confidence among investors about demand for AI chips, the shares have struggled to show a consistent increase since the chipmaker’s GPU Technology Conference in March where the Blackwell was unveiled. \nNvidia has battled in the past to manage supply and demand smoothly between product upgrades. Recent surges in demand for chips suitable for video games and cryptocurrency mining during the Covid-19 pandemic were followed soon after by a glut of GPUs. \nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley said they were confident that, even if the supply of Nvidia’s last-generation chips was more readily available now, “in the interim we are seeing new cloud, enterprise and sovereign customers taking all of the available Hopper supply”. \nThis article has been amended after Amazon clarified following publication that the orders had not yet been placed.",

        "Author": "George Hammond and Stephen Morris in San Francisco",
        "Content": "Scale AI has raised $1bn in a new funding round, doubling the data-labelling start-up’s valuation to about $14bn and paving the way for an initial public offering.\nThe deal underscores the critical nature of data in the race to build super-powerful artificial intelligence systems and the premium investors are willing to put on a commodity many regard as the new oil.\nThe San Francisco-headquartered company, which provides accurately labelled data for companies building AI models, has tapped existing investors, including venture capital firms Accel, which is leading the round, Nvidia, Josh Kushner’s Thrive Capital, Tiger Global Management and Index Ventures. New investors include Amazon, Meta, Intel Capital and AMD Ventures. \nThe round is the latest in a series of AI megadeals. OpenAI and Anthropic have raised billions of dollars in the past 12 months from Microsoft, Amazon and Google, and Elon Musk is in the process of raising as much as $6bn from investors for his own venture, xAI.\nBut unlike its biggest customers — which include OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft — Scale is not building its own generative AI models. \nIt was launched in 2016 to label the images used to develop autonomous driving systems. Since then it has grown rapidly by providing enormous volumes of accurately labelled data to train tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. \nThe company, which was valued at $7.3bn in 2021, employs a vast network of employees, many of them contractors, to do the labelling. Scale’s revenues were roughly $700mn last year, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.Its focus on what Alexandr Wang, co-founder and chief executive, describes as “one of the least sexy problems in AI” has given Scale a central position in the booming sector. \nAI models have improved dramatically over the past 18 months, but further leaps — such as the capability to reason, interpret text, images and speech simultaneously, or complete multi-step tasks — rely on larger, more complex data sets. \n“As an AI community we’ve exhausted all of the easy data, the internet data, and now we need to move on to more complex data,” said Wang. “The quantity matters but the quality is paramount. We’re no longer in a paradigm where more comments off Reddit are going to magically improve the models.” \nOne venture capitalist who chose not to participate in Scale’s latest funding round said he was concerned that the company’s revenues were too concentrated with a small clutch of AI businesses that are burning through cash in a fierce competition to build the best models. \n“We’re an infrastructure provider,” said Wang. “How the model development ecosystem develops above that obviously affects our business, as it does Nvidia, data centre providers and cloud providers.”\nWang has been courting the US government as well as top AI companies. The 27-year-old has become a prominent Silicon Valley figure in Washington, speaking to lawmakers about the importance of beating China in what he has described as a “prolonged tech cold war between the two greatest economic powers in the world”.\nRecommended\nEarlier this year, Scale was awarded a contract by the Department of Defense to test and evaluate various AI models. \nThe funding round is likely to be Scale’s last as a private company, according to one investor in the business. “The next logical thing is a public debut and there are investors [in the round] who could help with that,” they said.\n“As with every private company we always aim for every round to be the last round of funding that we need,” said Wang. “In terms of an IPO, we’re always eyeing the market.”\n",

        "Author": "ft",
        "Content": "No company has moved from an equity value of $1tn to $2tn as quickly as Nvidia. The chip designer doubled its market cap in less than nine months. The boom in generative artificial intelligence means demand for Nvidia chips still exceeds supply. But hitting the $3tn milestone is proving more difficult. \nTo some investors, AI hype has inflated valuations beyond reason. Michael Burry, whose short against the housing market was made famous in The Big Short, bet against semiconductor stocks last year. Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest dropped Nvidia in early 2023, claiming the market was pricing in too much optimism. \nYet compare Nvidia’s position with the company’s own market history and its valuation does not look stretched. The stock trades at 35 times expected earnings, down from 55 times at the start of 2022. Considering the size of its potential market and the pricing power it wields, Nvidia has a shot at becoming the most valuable stock in the US. \nThose concerned by Nvidia’s valuation point to the advances made by Google’s TPU, AMD’s MI300X and other would-be rivals. But Nvidia has two advantages: a head start and a closed ecosystem. It created its graphics processing units (GPUs) as processors for computer graphics. They turned out to be perfect for the huge calculations needed to train large language models for generative AI. Rivals are constrained by the lack of semiconductor fabrication plants needed to assemble new high-powered chips. These take years and tens of billions of dollars to build. \nNvidia also offers a one-stop shop for customers via its CUDA platform, which enables them to use programmes that run on Nvidia chips. One comparison might be Apple, which creates software that runs on its own hardware. \nCombined, these help Nvidia to dominate the AI chip market and set its own prices. The company’s gross margins have jumped from 65 per cent to nearly 73 per cent in the space of two years. Compare that with Intel, where margins are 41 per cent. Or AMD’s 51 per cent. \nSales could continue to jump. Training LLMs requires large numbers of GPUs. So does the next stage of generative AI use: inference. The market for processing generative AI requests like videos, images and text could be far larger than the market for training the models. Nvidia’s latest chip, the Blackwell B200 GPU, processes these 30 times more quickly than its last chip. That will keep the company ahead of rivals as the focus of generative AI shifts. \nelaine.moore@ft.com",

        "Author": "George Hammond in San Francisco ",
        "Content": "OpenAI has unveiled advances to its flagship artificial intelligence model, intensifying the competition with Google and other Big Tech groups pushing for breakthroughs in the technology. \nThe San Francisco start-up demonstrated a series of improvements to its GPT-4 model at an event on Monday, including the ability to interpret voice, video, images and code in a single interface — though it stopped short of revealing a much-anticipated new model.\nThe update, billed as GPT-4o, “provides GPT-4 level intelligence, but it’s much faster and improves on capabilities across text, vision and audio”, chief technology officer Mira Murati said, before demonstrating live voice translation across languages. Shares in language-learning tool Duolingo fell about 5 per cent following the announcement. \nThe updates come just one day before Google’s annual developer conference, which is expected to include a number of AI-related announcements, adding to a fierce contest among companies at the frontier of the technology to build models that can interpolate between text, images, audio and code, and complete certain tasks autonomously. \nMurati said her team have “no idea what Google is doing”, and that the event’s timing was coincidental. The updates announced on Monday would “shift the paradigm” of interaction between humans and machines, she added. \nThe company will offer its new model for free. “This is a very concrete way for us to advance our mission to provide these benefits to everyone. That’s not trivial,” said Murati. \nOpenAI has set the pace in the race to build super-powerful AI systems since the launch of its ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022, and its early dominance in the space has pushed its valuation up to more than $80bn. \nSam Altman, OpenAI’s co-founder and chief executive, has said the company’s next AI model would be “materially better” than GPT-4. But OpenAI has sought to temper expectations that the launch of the new model — which was widely expected to be released in the first half of 2024 — was imminent.\nOpenAI was likely to share an update on GPT-5 at some point in 2024, according to Murati, although she did not specify when. \nIn the meantime, start-ups including Anthropic and Mistral, as well as big tech companies Google and Meta, have narrowed OpenAI’s early lead, developing AI tools that can complete complex tasks and generate lines of code, text or images.\nRecommended\nThere is also OpenAI’s closest partner, Microsoft. As well as committing $13bn to OpenAI and supplying the start-up with computing power and access to chips, Microsoft has struck deals with rival start-ups including Inflection and Mistral, and is working on its own AI models which would compete with OpenAI’s technology.\nCompetition between the companies has been fuelled by a supply of increasingly powerful semiconductors, particularly Nvidia’s Graphics Processing Units. That has given the chip company a central role in the push to advance AI. \nMurati closed her presentation on Monday by thanking Nvidia chief Jensen Huang “for bringing us the most advanced GPUs possible” to run its demos. \nAdditional reporting by Madhumita Murgia in London",

        "Author": "Tim Bradshaw in London",
        "Content": "Apple has unveiled new iPads featuring what it called “an outrageously powerful chip for AI”, signalling the Silicon Valley giant’s growing focus on artificial intelligence services. \nThe company launched the “M4” chip for its latest iPad Pro devices on Tuesday, just months after it introduced the M3 alongside new Macs in October. \nAI developers’ insatiable demand for computing power is driving Big Tech companies such as Apple and Nvidia to increase the pace at which they push out more powerful processors capable of handling vast amounts of data. \nChip design has become a vital capability for the world’s richest tech companies, with Microsoft, Amazon and Google all unveiling new processors focused on AI in the past few months. \nTim Millet, Apple’s vice-president of platform architecture, hailed the combination of M4’s central processing unit, graphics processor and dedicated AI capabilities — which it calls its “neural engine” — as a big step forward over its previous chips. \nHe said at an Apple event on Tuesday that these components taken together made the “M4 an outrageously powerful chip for AI”. \nApple has come under pressure from investors to unveil new AI features to compete with Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google, at a time when iPhone sales have been falling. \nThe explosion in new AI apps since OpenAI launched its breakthrough ChatGPT chatbot 18 months ago has triggered a race to secure the powerful processors needed to build so-called large language models — AI systems capable of producing humanlike text and imagery. \nApple has designed its own Arm-based processors for its iPhones since 2010 and made the switch from Intel chips for its Mac computers in 2020 with the M1. \nThe latest iPad Pro models unveiled at an event on Tuesday offer thinner and brighter screens that require more sophisticated processors. But, like earlier incarnations of its M-series chips, the M4 is likely to mark the beginning of a wider upgrade to its custom chips across Apple’s product range, paving the way for more advanced AI capabilities. \nNvidia, the Silicon Valley company whose chips have become highly sought after by start-ups and Big Tech companies, launched a new generation of its AI processors last month as it looks to cement its dominance. \nAnalysts say that Apple’s latest chips give it an opportunity to bring many AI features that run in the cloud on to its customers’ own devices, making apps run faster and offering greater privacy. \nRecommended\n“The flexibility of Apple silicon architecture remains one of their biggest technical advantages over competitors,” said Ben Bajarin, tech industry analyst at Creative Strategies, adding that the company was “starting to be more intentional in calling out its [chips’] role in AI”. \nMillet said the M4 took advantage of the most advanced manufacturing process technology that is currently available at scale — the so-called second-generation 3nm node — which promises to improve power efficiency. The chip also offers more memory bandwidth, a crucial feature for data-hungry AI applications. \nHe took a swipe at Apple’s rivals by pointing out the iPhone maker had “for years” been dedicating a portion of its processors to AI features, known as the neural engine, claiming it was “more powerful” than the equivalent chip in “any AI PC today”. \nApple’s PC rival Microsoft is planning a Windows event this month that is expected to focus on AI and portability, featuring new Arm-based processors from Qualcomm. \nRecommended\n“The new iPad Pro with M4 is a great example of how building best-in-class custom silicon enables breakthrough products,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice-president of hardware technologies.\nApple’s event also featured a redesigned Pencil stylus for its tablets and a more affordable version of its larger 13-inch iPad model.

        "Title": "Companies reap bigger dividends from happier staff",
        "Author": "Chris Newlands",
        "Content": "Just 18 months ago, the Californian chipmaker Nvidia — which started life in 1993 as a specialist provider of 3D graphics for computer games — operated in relative obscurity. However, a surge of interest in artificial intelligence has changed all that. As investors fell over themselves to find the companies they thought would make the most money from generative AI, Nvidia’s share price took off.\nLast year, it was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500, rising 239 per cent, while in February this year it recorded the largest one-day gain in Wall Street history after its quarterly report beat expectations.\nThe fact that Nvidia is one of the dominant suppliers of AI hardware and software suggests the share price jump is no fluke. But there are some observers who believe these impressive stock market gains are not only linked to what Nvidia makes but also to the way it treats its staff.\nBecause as well as notching up hefty share price increases, Nvidia routinely appears either at the top, or near the top, of lists of best companies to work for. It is frequently recognised for its flexible working practices, generous paid leave, and subsidised childcare.\nFor academics Jan-Emmanuel De Neve and George Ward at the University of Oxford, and Micah Kaats at Harvard University, it is no surprise, then, that the company’s share price has performed so strongly: their recent study provides the clearest link yet between staff wellbeing and financial performance in quoted US companies. “We find that higher levels of wellbeing generally predict higher firm valuations, higher return on assets, higher gross profits, and better stock market performance,” they write in a 42-page paper.\nTheir analysis finds that companies with greater profitability and higher stock market performance tend to have staff who cite greater happiness, purpose and job satisfaction. The academics say theirs is the most comprehensive study to date to make this link.\nRecommended\n“The reality is that many employers have not always prioritised the wellbeing of their employees,” says De Neve, professor of economics and behavioural science at Oxford’s Saïd Business School. “Investing in wellbeing is often seen as a trade-off with other organisational goals. However, contrary to this assumption, the firm-level evidence we present suggests that there may be strong business-related reasons to invest in employee wellbeing.”\nThe study was based on 15mn surveys completed by employees at more than 1,600 publicly listed companies, which was collected via the Indeed recruitment website.\nSarah Carroll, a career expert at Indeed, says: “The study shows the top 100 companies for wellbeing delivered 20 per cent higher returns than the S&P 500, and 30 per cent higher returns than the Nasdaq. They also found that firms being mentioned in ‘best places to work’ lists noticed a stock market bump in the days following the announcement.”\nPrioritising workplace wellbeing, she adds, is more than just a nice-to-have: “it is key to creating happier and more productive teams”.\nThere is no one-size-fits-all approach to wellbeing and it equally doesn’t require a certain budget to execute well\nNvidia reports profits well into the tens of billions of dollars and is obviously well equipped to show generosity to its employees. But Chris Eldridge, chief executive, UK and Ireland and North America, at recruitment group Robert Walters, says workplace wellbeing is not only achievable for companies with sizeable budgets.\n“There are numerous ways employers can be supportive of workplace wellbeing without breaking the bank,” he suggests. “Flexible work arrangements are one of the most widely used, and widely successful, incentives that could also actually save money for companies in terms of rent and running costs.\n“Improving access to mental health resources and offering paid sabbaticals as well as volunteering days all enrich employee wellbeing — and come at a low cost to the company,” says Eldridge.\nTrisha Brookes, director of people and culture at recruiter Hays, agrees: “There is no one-size-fits-all approach to wellbeing and it equally doesn’t require a certain budget to execute well. One of the most effective ways to support employee wellbeing is to understand what people want within your organisation — however big or small.”\nSo, what are some of the perks employees most want that can help drive share price success? According to Brookes, employees are less inspired by benefits that may appear superficial, such as pool tables, office dogs, or onsite baristas.\nTaking the UK as an example, she says Hays’ own research shows prospective employees want more than 28 days paid annual leave, additional days off if and when they need them for personal reasons, and private medical insurance.\n“The benefits and perks now most favoured are those that will have a tangible impact on an employee’s life outside of work — rather than inside the office,” Brookes explains.",

Do you think they should be making that much? Send your grievances, support or Big Law horror stories to due.diligence@ft.com.\nIn today’s newsletter:\nUniCredit’s Orcel on dealmaking\nDocuments shed new light on Adani’s coal dealings\nPrada and Gucci at FT’s luxury summit\nTo the outside world, Andrea Orcel’s three years as UniCredit chief executive can be summed up by two issues: speculation over takeover targets and pressure to exit Russia.\nThe 61-year-old Roman recently sat down with the FT’s Owen Walker and Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli to discuss his time running Italy’s second-biggest bank.\nBusiness has been booming, with the group’s share price quadrupling during his tenure.\nIt’s widely assumed within the investment banking industry that Orcel’s efforts to boost the bank’s share price — through operational efficiency and generous shareholder payouts — is part of a broader move to put UniCredit in the driving seat when it comes to consolidating Europe’s fragmented banking sector.\nOrcel was Europe’s top bank dealmaker at Merrill Lynch in the run-up to the global financial crisis, where he advised on megadeals, including the sale of ABN Amro to RBS, Fortis and Santander. That’s only heightened speculation.\nUniCredit has been linked with deals for a number of Italian and European banks over the past few years, including Germany’s Commerzbank, Russia’s Bank Otkritie and local rivals Monte dei Paschi di Siena and Banco BPM.\nOrcel told the FT that industry scuttlebutt about UniCredit deals was only natural. “Theoretically, most of the rumours are true inasmuch as, in every single market we look at every possible target,” he said.\n“The interest is there under the right conditions, but we haven’t found the right conditions yet, and we have had the discipline to say no.” \nTalk of deals among European banks has heated up in recent weeks, following BBVA’s hostile bid for Spanish competitor Sabadell and comments from French President Emmanuel Macron, where his support for a European capital markets union and cross-border dealmaking appeared to include moves for French lenders.\n“It’s good to have this . . . commitment from a major European leader,” Orcel said.\nBut while M&A is likely to be a central theme in Orcel’s next three years at UniCredit, a more pressing concern is the bank’s Russian subsidiary. A St Petersburg court last week ordered the seizure of €463mn of the bank’s assets.\nWhen it comes to dealing with UniCredit’s Russian business, Orcel’s famed negotiating skills will be put to the test.\nAdani Group is yet again facing suspicions of fraud.\nThe Indian conglomerate appears to have passed off low-quality coal as far more expensive and cleaner fuel in transactions with the country’s state power utility, according to evidence seen by the FT’s Dan McCrum, Chris Cook and John Reed. \nThe revelation throws fresh light on allegations of a long-running coal scam, and adds an environmental dimension to accusations of corruption associated with the group.\nUsing low-grade coal for power means burning more fuel. As a result, the documents — which were secured by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and reviewed by the FT — suggest the company may have fraudulently obtained bumper profits at the expense of air quality.\nThe evidence is all in the receipts. In January 2014, Adani purchased a shipment of coal in Indonesia said to contain 3,500 calories per kilogramme. But the same shipment was sold to the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution company as 6,000-calorie coal — one of the most valuable grades.\nAnd there’s more. The FT also matched documentation for another 22 shipments that same year involving the same parties. They indicate a pattern of grade inflation in the supply of 1.5mn tonnes of coal.\nYou are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic.

But the probe became bogged down in a court fight over documents. \nRecords show that the group used British Virgin Islands-based Supreme Union Investors as middlemen in the transactions. Adani, which denies wrongdoing and allegations of fraud, is still one of the country’s biggest coal importers.\nThe FT’s been circling Adani’s coal imports for months, while the company’s use of middlemen in some of the company’s schemes has been raising eyebrows for years. \nLast year, an FT investigation found that between 2021 and 2023 Adani paid more than $5bn to middlemen for coal imported to India far in excess of market prices.\nAdani’s been trying to rebrand itself as a big renewable energy player while also enduring political debate over the power and influence enjoyed by billionaires (like Gautam Adani) in India.\nIt’s a delicate time for the company to face a new round of allegations.\nLeaders from brands such as Louis Vuitton and Bottega Veneta descended on Venice this week for the FT’s Business of Luxury summit, where executives divulged their views on the sector’s future.\nUp first: Prada.

        "Content": "Good morning. We have never covered the New York State judicial system here at Unhedged, a policy we do not intend to change. As far as this newsletter is concerned, the most interesting news yesterday was the downward revision to first-quarter GDP, and a few juicy earnings reports (see below). Email me your non-judicial, non-political, non-partisan thoughts: robert.armstrong@ft.com.\nBoth HP Inc, perhaps the dowdiest and slowest-growing of American tech companies, and Salesforce, one of the sexiest and fastest-growing, reported quarterly results on Wednesday after the market closed. On Thursday, shares in tech’s tortoise rose 17 per cent, as the personal computer sales cycle appears to be turning up. The hare’s fell 20 per cent, after the company targeted growth of a mere 8 per cent — a rate HP can only dream of — in the current quarter.\nHP makes antiques or, more specifically, PCs, printers, and printer cartridges. Its growth rate since it was split off from HP Enterprise in late 2015 is 1.5 per cent a year; earnings have grown at 3 per cent. Over that same period, Salesforce, which sells web-based customer management software, has increased revenues at 22 per cent a year, and earnings at 44 per cent.\nAnd here is the total return for the two stocks over the period:\nHP has returned more than 16 per cent a year; Salesforce has a shade under 13. I mention the vast difference in growth and the divergence in returns to illustrate a very simple point. Even in an era when growth stocks as a group have done much better than value stocks as a group, the price you pay for a stock still matters a lot. HP has long traded on a single-digit multiple of earnings; no one ever thought laptops and expensive ink were the products of the future. Salesforce is one of the great software disrupters. And HP has been the better stock.\nMore to the point, HP now trades at 11 times this year’s estimated earnings, expensive compared to its history; Salesforce, at 21 times, is as cheap as it has ever been. Which would you buy now? Speaking for myself, I gain new respect for HPs business model every time I buy a sadistically priced cartridge for my printer.\nIn the opening paragraphs of a very nice column about Nvidia, by friend and former colleague James Mackintosh argues that one narrative US equity bulls have been spinning, about increasing market breadth, has recently fallen apart:\nRemember all the bulls earlier this year getting excited that the rally was broadening out beyond the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, and how wider gains were a sign that the market’s rise was sustainable? Not so much.\nThis month, as indices hit fresh records, just four giant technology stocks added more market value than the rest of the S&P 500 put together. A brief burst of outperformance by smaller stocks seems to have petered out again. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet between them have added over $1.4tn his month, more than the other 296 stocks that rose put together. Half of the gain was just one company, chipmaker Nvidia.\nThis was mildly alarming to me, inasmuch as I was one of those people pointing out the improved breadth. Back in late February, I wrote that it was not just big tech pushing the market upwards. While the big companies, by virtue of their sheer size, were contributing a large share of the total value created in the market, the rest of the market was rising nicely in percentage terms, I argued. I focused on the period since the market hit a bottom in October of 2023. My chart from back then: \nThis was a blip, as it turns out. You can see this, for example, in the performance of the capitalisation-weighted S&P 500, which is dragged around by Big Tech, relative to its equal-weighted doppelgänger, which is not:\nFrom October 2023 through February of 2024, Big Tech stocks outperformed the rest of the market only a little. That trend continued until about a month ago when, as Mackintosh points out, Big Tech started to run away again. And as the above chart shows, Big Tech’s dominance has been the normal pattern, with brief interruptions, for almost a year and a half now.\nTwo questions. First (and we have asked this one before) how much should a concentrated market worry us? This year, 87 per cent of the dollar gains in the S&P 500 come from 10 stocks. But in the past, narrow markets have not presaged doom. Second, why have the Big Tech stocks started to pull away again now? Part of it is simply Nvidia’s excellent earnings, but I doubt that is the whole story.\nPrivate equity and healthcare. And plumbing.\nCan’t get enough of Unhedged?

        "Title": "Nvidia’s rivals take aim at its software dominance",
        "Author": "Tim Bradshaw in London",
        "Content": "Nvidia’s rivals and biggest customers are rallying behind an OpenAI-led initiative to build software that would make it easier for developers of artificial intelligence to switch away from its chips. \nSilicon Valley-based Nvidia has become the world’s most valuable chipmaker thanks to a near monopoly on the chips needed to create large AI systems, but supply shortages and high prices are pushing customers to seek out alternatives. \nMaking new AI chips only solves part of the problem, however. While Nvidia is best known for its powerful processors, industry figures say its “secret sauce” is its software platform, Cuda, which enables chips originally designed for graphics to speed up AI applications. \nEngineers at some of Nvidia’s biggest customers are taking aim at Cuda by helping to develop Triton, software that was first released by OpenAI in 2021 and designed to make code run software on a wide range of AI chips.\nMeta, Microsoft and Google, which have all spent tens of billions of dollars on Nvidia chips, are contributing to Triton at the same time as producing their own AI chips.\nAt a time when Nvidia is investing heavily to expand its software platform, rival chipmakers Intel, AMD and Qualcomm are also seeking to use Triton to help lure customers from Nvidia.\nEven as they continue to spend billions of dollars on Nvidia’s latest products, big tech companies hope that Triton will help break the stranglehold that the chipmaker has on AI hardware. \n“Essentially it breaks the Cuda lock-in,” said Greg Lavender, Intel’s chief technology officer. \nNvidia dominates the market for building and deploying large language models, including the system behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT. That has propelled its valuation to more than $2tn and left rivals Intel and AMD rushing to catch up. Analysts expect Nvidia to report this week that its latest quarterly revenues more than tripled year on year, with profits increasing more than six times over.\nBut Nvidia’s hardware has only become such a hot commodity because of the accompanying software that it has developed over almost two decades, creating a formidable “moat” that competitors have struggled to overcome. \n“What Nvidia does for a living is not [just] build the chip: we build an entire supercomputer, from the chip to the system to the interconnects . . . but very importantly the software,” chief executive Jensen Huang said at its GPU Technology Conference in March. He has described Nvidia’s software as the “operating system” of AI.\nFounded more than 30 years ago to target video gamers, Nvidia’s pivot to AI was facilitated by its Cuda software, which the company created in 2006 to enable general-purpose applications to run on its graphics processing units. \nSince then, Nvidia has invested billions of dollars to build hundreds of software tools and services to make running AI applications on its GPUs quicker and easier. Nvidia executives say it now hires twice as many software engineers as hardware staff. \n“I think people are underestimating what Nvidia has actually built,” said David Katz, a partner at Radical Ventures, an AI-focused investor. \n“They built an ecosystem of software around their products which is efficient, easy to use and actually works — and makes very complex things simple,” he added. “It is something that has evolved with a massive community of users over a very long time.” \nNonetheless, the high price of Nvidia’s products and the long queue to buy its most advanced gear, such as the H100 and forthcoming GB200 “super chip”, have driven some of its biggest customers — including Microsoft, Amazon and Meta — to seek out alternatives or develop their own. \nHowever, because most AI systems and applications already run on Nvidia’s Cuda software, it is time-consuming and risky for developers to rewrite them for other processors, such as AMD’s MI300, Intel’s Gaudi 3 or Amazon’s Trainium. \n“The thing is, if you want to compete with Nvidia in this space, you not only need to build hardware that is competitive, you also need to make it easy to use,” said Gennady Pekhimenko, chief executive of CentML, a start-up making software to optimise AI tasks, and associate professor of computer science at the University of Toronto. “Nvidia’s chips are really good but, in my opinion, their biggest advantage is on the software side.” \nRivals such as Google’s TPU AI chips might offer comparable performance in benchmark tests but “convenience and software support makes a big difference” in Nvidia’s favour, according to Pekhimenko. \nNvidia executives argue that its software work makes it possible to deploy a new AI model on its latest chips in “seconds” and offers continuous efficiency improvements. But those benefits come with a catch. \n“We are seeing a lot of Cuda lock-in in the [AI] ecosystem, which makes it very difficult to utilise non-Nvidia hardware,” said Meryem Arik, co-founder of TitanML, a London-based AI start-up. TitanML started out using Cuda but last year’s GPU shortages prompted it to rewrite its products in Triton. Arik said this helped TitanML win new customers who wanted to avoid what she called the “Cuda tax”. \nTriton, whose co-creator Philippe Tillet was hired by OpenAI in 2019, is open source, meaning anyone can view, adapt or improve its code. Proponents argue that gives Triton an inherent appeal to developers over Cuda, which is proprietary to Nvidia. Triton started out working with Nvidia’s GPUs only but it now supports AMD’s MI300, with support for Intel’s Gaudi and other accelerator chips planned soon. \nMeta, for example, has put Triton software at the heart of its in-house-developed AI chip, MTIA. When Meta released the second generation of MTIA last month, its engineers said that Triton was “highly efficient” and “sufficiently hardware-agnostic” to work with a range of chip architectures. \nDevelopers at OpenAI’s rivals such as Anthropic — and even Nvidia itself — have also worked on improving Triton, according to logs on GitHub and talks about the toolkit. \nTriton is not the only attempt to challenge Nvidia’s software advantage. Intel, Google, Arm and Qualcomm are among the members of the UXL Foundation, an industry alliance developing a Cuda alternative based on Intel’s open-source OneAPI platform. \nChris Lattner, a prominent former senior engineer at Apple, Tesla and Google, has launched Mojo, a programming language for AI developers whose pitch includes: “No Cuda required”. Only a small minority of the world’s software developers know how to code with Cuda and it is hard to learn, he argues. With his start-up Modular, Lattner hopes Mojo will make it “dramatically easier” to build AI for “developers of all kinds — not just the elite experts at the biggest AI companies”. \n“Today’s AI software is built using software languages from over 15 years ago, akin to using a BlackBerry today,” he said. \nRecommended\nEven if Triton or Mojo are competitive, it will still take Nvidia’s rivals years to catch up to Cuda’s head start. Analysts at Citi recently estimated that Nvidia’s share of the generative AI chip market will decline from about 81 per cent next year to about 63 per cent by 2030, suggesting it will remain dominant for many years to come. \n“Building a competitive chip against Nvidia is a hard problem but an easier problem than building the entire software stack and making people start using it,” said Pekhimenko. \nIntel’s Lavender remains optimistic. “The software ecosystem will evolve,” he said. “I think the playing field will level.” \nAdditional reporting by Camilla Hodgson in London and Michael Acton in San Francisco",

        "Content": "Hello from sunny California. I’m in Los Angeles this week, along with thousands of bankers, investors, policymakers and tech executives, for the annual Milken Institute Global Conference.\nWhile the conference, now in its 27th year, is known as an exclusive event for financiers, tech heavyweights are increasingly drawn to the gathering in palm tree-lined Beverly Hills. For example, Elon Musk skipped the Met Gala this year and joined the conference on Monday evening in a session where he shared his visions for AI and colonising Mars, as well as his concerns about declining populations and illegal immigration.\nMusk was not the only one talking about AI at the conference. The words “artificial intelligence” came up at least five times in every panel and sideline meeting I attended, and even in casual conversations with fellow conference attendees while waiting for our Ubers.\nWhile the theme of this year’s conference is “Shaping a Shared Future”, much of the discussion about AI centred on how the US should compete with China on this technology. A panel on the geopolitics of AI said there was “not a lot” of hope to include Beijing in the talks about AI safety and regulation that the US is having with its allies. Even the idea of the UN serving as a potential platform for building a global AI governance framework was dismissed.\n“The more you do things in the UN, the more you play into China and Russia’s hands,” said Karen Pierce, Britain’s Ambassador to the US.\nI left the Milken conference wondering: How can we govern this immensely powerful and rapidly developing technology when there is such a slim chance that the world’s two AI superpowers can work together on this issue?\nArtificial intelligence is costly, and not only from a financial perspective. As more companies are building data centres to train large language models or power their AI services, demand for electricity is rising at record speed.\nGlobal power demand from data centres could more than double from 2022 to 2026, the International Energy Agency estimates, and some Asian countries are already feeling the heat, Nikkei Asia’s Sayumi Take writes.\nIn Japan, where the government is working to update its basic energy policy by next March, this surging demand for power is raising hurdles for the country’s decarbonisation goals.\nThe issue is also looming over South Korea and countries in south-east Asia, where the market for data centres is also growing.\nSoftBank has signalled it has no intention of being left out of the latest artificial intelligence funding frenzy by leading a $1.05bn investment in autonomous car start-up Wayve.\nMicrosoft and Nvidia are also backing London-based Wayve in what is Europe’s largest ever AI financing, the Financial Times’ Peter Campbell, Tim Bradshaw and David Keohane report.\nSoftBank chief Masayoshi Son has been on the hunt for big AI deals following September’s blockbuster public listing of Arm, the UK-based chipmaker in which the Japanese conglomerate owns a majority stake.\nBut since ChatGPT reignited investor interest in AI 18 months ago, SoftBank has been slower to deploy capital in the sector than US tech companies such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google.\nAfter SoftBank’s Vision Fund splurged tens of billions of dollars at lofty valuations on companies including Uber, WeWork and ByteDance, with decidedly mixed results, the Japanese group is now stepping up its due diligence.\nKentaro Matsui, head of new business at SoftBank and a managing partner in its Vision Fund, told the FT that it took 18 months from its first meeting with Wayve before a formal investment decision was made.\nThe majority of the $39bn Chips Act funding has been distributed, with more than half of the funding going to Intel, TSMC and Samsung. And there is good reason for that. The three companies are expected to help the US more than triple its semiconductor manufacturing capacity by 2032, giving the country control of almost 30 per cent of advanced chipmaking, according to a report from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and Boston Consulting Group (BCG).\nBy comparison, while China has laid out more than $142bn in government incentives to build its domestic semiconductor industry, the country is expected to be able to make only 2 per cent of the world’s most advanced chips by then. Both China and the US had no meaningful advanced chip manufacturing capacity as of 2022.\nIn an interview with Nikkei Asia’s Yifan Yu, SIA president and CEO John Neuffer said these numbers serve as the first report card for the Chips Act, which “looks pretty strong”. And the report card, he predicts, will help convince the next Congress and administration — regardless of who wins the November presidential election — to back another round of support for the chip industry.\nStartups around the world have been struggling with a funding slowdown, but in Vietnam they are facing an added hurdle: a government crackdown on corruption. In the past two years, the clampdown has included the dismissals of two presidents and a top lawmaker as well as stock exchange and regulatory officials in what is usually a stable one-party state.\nVietnam’s unprecedented campaign against corruption has cast a pall over the country’s start-up scene, indicating gloom has spread beyond the property and banking industries most affected by recent criminal sentences linked to graft, local investors told Nikkei Asia’s Lien Hoang in Ho Chi Minh City.\nVenture capitalists expressed concern about the crackdown’s impact on macroeconomic sentiment, adding to a funding winter already being felt across south-east Asia’s technology industry. A recent report shows the country’s venture capital funding dropped 17 per cent in 2023 from the previous year, though that was less drastic than the 35 per cent fall globally.\nFour start-ups lead China’s race to match OpenAI’s ChatGPT (FT)\nEurope faces up to China’s EV dominance as carbon-zero targets loom (Nikkei Asia)\nUS revokes licences for supply of chips to China’s Huawei (FT)\nTikTok challenges ‘extreme’ US divest-or-ban bill in court (FT)\nBaidu PR chief’s videos spark backlash over harsh workplace culture (Nikkei Asia)\nBYD Americas CEO says EV maker is not TikTok or Huawei (Nikkei Asia)\nUniversal Music ends boycott of TikTok with new licensing deal (FT)\nMicrosoft to build $3.3bn AI data centre on old Foxconn site (Nikkei Asia)\nCan Elon Musk’s Tesla keep straddling the US and China?

        "Author": "Tabby Kinder in San Francisco",
        "Content": "Shares in Arm dropped by as much as 10 per cent after the UK chip designer issued lacklustre revenue projections for the coming year, raising concerns that tech companies’ spending on artificial intelligence hardware could slow down.\nThe SoftBank-backed group, which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of an AI spending boom since it listed on Nasdaq in September, forecast revenues of between $3.8bn and $4.1bn for the year to March 2025. Analysts had expected revenues of $4.01bn.\nThe share price fall in after-hours trading on Wednesday came despite Arm reporting a 47 per cent surge in fourth-quarter revenue to $928mn. That pushed annual revenue to more than $3bn for the first time and exceeded its own guidance of between $850mn and $900mn.\nThe results are Arm’s third since its blockbuster IPO, which valued it at $65bn and marked the biggest US listing in almost two years. Since then its market capitalisation has soared, reaching a peak of about $117bn in February. Its market value on Wednesday before the earnings announcement was $109bn. \nChief executive Rene Haas said that as AI software models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s Llama, “become larger and smarter, their requirements for more compute with greater power efficiency can only be realised through Arm”. \nIn a call with shareholders, Haas said: “The AI tailwind delivered unprecedented growth for our business. The growth and outlook for the company could not be brighter.” He cited accelerating revenues from royalties for its newest chip designs in its smartphones and infrastructure businesses, as well as growth in demand in chips that power data centres and autonomous vehicles.\nChief financial officer Jason Child said Arm expected to maintain total revenue growth of at least 20 per cent year on year in fiscal years 2026 and 2027.\nRevenues in the latest quarter were boosted by a surge in royalties for its V9 chip designs, which are licensed to power smartphones, data centres and AI chips manufactured by companies including Nvidia and Amazon to run large language models. Arm sells chip design licences to manufacturers that pay royalties on each unit shipped. Royalty revenue rose 37 per cent to $514mn in the quarter. Arm said chips based on its V9 technology now contribute a fifth of its royalty revenues, compared with 15 per cent in the previous quarter. \nArm had revised up its revenue guidance for the fourth quarter in February due to the surging demand for new AI applications that had driven higher demand for its chip architecture. \nShares in AI chip manufacturers such as Nvidia and AMD have rallied this year as tech companies outlined plans to keep spending heavily on AI computing infrastructure, raising forecasts for capital spending in 2024 by billions of dollars.

        "Content": "Fifty corporate winners from the coronavirus pandemic have lost roughly $1.5tn in market value since the end of 2020, as investors turn their backs on many of the stocks that rocketed during early lockdowns.\nAccording to data from S&P Global, technology groups dominate the list of the 50 companies with a market value of more than $10bn that made the biggest percentage gains in 2020.\nBut these early-pandemic winners have collectively shed more than a third of their total market value, the equivalent of $1.5tn, since the end of 2020, Financial Times calculations based on Bloomberg data found.\nVideo-conferencing company Zoom, whose shares soared as much as 765 per cent in 2020 as businesses switched to remote working, has been one of the biggest losers. Its stock has fallen about 80 per cent, equivalent to more than a $77bn drop in market value, since the end of that year. \nYou are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser.\nCloud-based communications company RingCentral also surged in the remote working boom of 2020 but has since shed about 90 per cent of its value, as it competes with technology giants such as Alphabet and Microsoft.\nExercise bike maker Peloton has been another big loser, with shares down more than 97 per cent since the end of 2020, equivalent to about a $43bn loss of market value.\nPeloton on Thursday said chief executive Barry McCarthy would step down and it would cut 15 per cent of its workforce, the latest in a series of cost-saving measures. \nThe losses come as the sharp acceleration of trends such as videoconferencing and online shopping driven by the lockdowns has proven less durable than expected, as more workers migrate back to the office and high interest rates and living costs hit ecommerce demand.\n“Some companies probably thought that shock was going to be permanent,” said Steven Blitz, chief US economist at TS Lombard. “Now they’re getting a painful bounceback from that.”\nIn percentage terms, Tesla was the biggest winner of 2020. The electric-car maker’s market value jumped 787 per cent to $669bn by the end of that December, but has since slipped back to $589bn.\nSingapore-based internet company Sea came in second, as its market value jumped from $19bn to $102bn following a pandemic-era surge for all three of its core businesses: gaming, ecommerce and digital payments. But the company has since lost more than 60 per cent of its end-2020 value amid fears of a slowdown in growth. \nEcommerce groups Shopify, JD.com and Chewy, which initially thrived as online spending ballooned, have also suffered big losses.\nYou are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser.\nVaccine hopes and demand for medical treatments also buoyed pharmaceutical groups such as Moderna and Pfizer in 2020, as well as lesser-known Chinese groups, including WuXi Biologics, Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products and Alibaba Health Information Technology. \nMany vaccine makers’ pandemic-era gains have reversed, however, as investors become concerned about unpredictable demand for the shots. Pfizer has now completely erased its gains from 2020 and 2021, despite co-developing a widely used vaccine alongside German biotechnology company BioNTech. \nRecommended\nJust seven of the 50 biggest corporate winners of 2020 have gained market value: Chinese carmaker BYD, cyber security group CrowdStrike, software companies The Trade Desk and Datadog, T-Mobile, Chinese technology company CATL and Latin American online marketplace Mercado Libre.\nHowever, other companies that made gains during the pandemic have gone on to fare even better, including technology giants Nvidia and Amazon, which ranked 54th and 100th, respectively, among the best performers of 2020. Nvidia has added more than $1.9tn in market value since the end of 2020, thanks to the boom in artificial intelligence-linked stocks. \nAdditional reporting by Ray Douglas in London",

But over nibbles and wine at a recent event, a couple of professional fund managers admitted their grand investment thesis at the moment is as follows: the market wants to go up. Don’t overthink it.\nYes, it’s bad to talk about “the market” as if it’s a person. No, it’s not a very sophisticated analysis. But it has been a widespread worldview of late, so much so that Goldman Sachs this week said its Risk Appetite Indicator — a measure of enthusiasm for risk across a wide range of asset classes — was close to its highs from 2021, and moving towards the highest levels since 1991.\nSuch an upbeat mood tends to make market nerds nervous. It smacks of complacency and bakes in extra vulnerability to shocks from growth or interest rates or any of the other factors that bump asset prices around. “This could present a speed limit for risky assets into the summer,” the bank’s analysts said. \nThey were not wrong. Hours after the report was published, stocks pulled back quite hard.

Investors are getting used to the idea that interest rates might not fall in the US this year, even though that marks a humbling reversal from what was seen as a nailed-on certainty of multiple cuts at the start of this year. What they are not ready for is rate rises. We are getting uncomfortably close to the point where that becomes a serious prospect, but we are not quite there yet. So, this week’s wobble notwithstanding, it still feels as if fund managers’ fingers are always hovering over the “buy” button.\nAs an example, in mid-May, it took only a tiny pullback in US inflation to prompt stocks to rocket to new all-time highs. Consumer price index inflation sank to 3.4 per cent in April, from 3.5 in March. That is hardly a convincing return to the sweet, sweet disinflation that fund managers like so much. But the slight slowdown was enough for the S&P 500 index of blue-chip US stocks to push into new territory. Corporate bond markets remain very much in demand, pulling the gap in yields between credit and government bonds ever tighter. The gap, or spread, may be skinny, but the all-in yield, at north of 5 per cent in the US seven- to 10-year maturities, is still more than enough to keep specialist investors and credit newbies interested. \nOf course, if you actively want to avoid looking on the bright side of life, you can. Société Générale’s permabear-in-chief, Albert Edwards, is railing against the US Federal Reserve, arguing it is “sowing the seeds of yet another policy disaster”.\n“In my opinion, tighter for longer is bonkers quite simply because it is now driving goods inflation into deep deflation to balance out higher services inflation,” he said. “It ranks with that catastrophic central bank policy error of keeping monetary policy super loose for the 25 years prior to the pandemic.” There’s no pleasing some people.\nAnd for sure, those who believe the Fed is incompetent, and/or that the US is hurtling towards a fiscal crisis and even those who believe the dollar is about to lose its status as the global reserve currency could be right this time. Maybe the sky-high gold price really is telling us something. But by definition, none of these tail risks is imminent or likely. \nEven Michael Wilson of Morgan Stanley, one of the most outspoken bears on Wall Street, has lifted his 12-month target for the S&P 500 to 5,400 from a paltry, and deeply under water 4,500. Cynics might see that as a contrarian indicator, given how long Wilson stuck to his bearish guns, but others who have been more positive on the market for some time have also turned up the dial. UBS’s chief investment office has also raised its year-end target for 2024 for the S&P 500 to 5,500, from 5,200. It also anticipates the index will hit 5,600 by the middle of next year.\nGeopolitical shocks that could serve to undermine risky markets, such as the sudden death of Iran’s president in a helicopter crash or China’s hostile rhetoric towards Taiwan’s new leader have proven incapable of taking the shine off stocks. What’s not to like?\nMatt King, formerly of Citi and now running Satori Insights, nonetheless cannot resist urging a little caution. “The trouble with momentum-driven markets is that momentum and Fomo [fear of missing out] are often all that’s driving them,” he said in a recent note. “That may still suffice to trump all other considerations, and inflict considerable pain on anyone daring to try a value- or fundamental-driven short, but it nevertheless creates an underlying fragility.” \nPerhaps. But as my wine-supping companions argued, the market wants to go up. The tension between this basic-but-compelling instinct and the spectre of higher interest rates will define how markets behave for the rest of this year,\nkatie.martin@ft.com\n",

        "Content": "Good morning. Its Jenn Hughes standing in for Rob today. When even a fifth consecutive blowout quarter and share jump from Nvidia can’t hold up the broader market, it suggests investors are casting about elsewhere for their next AI-related bets. Got ideas? Email me: jennifer.hughes@ft.com. \nA quick programming note: There will be no Unhedged on Monday, but Rob will be back in your inboxes next week. \nThere was a back-to-school feeling to stock markets yesterday. After weeks in which it’s been about the next big earnings report and the anticipation of fresh information, Nvidia’s blasting past bullish expectations on Wednesday marks the end of the headliners.\nWhen even a 9 per cent rally for Nvidia can’t encourage a daily gain for the S&P 500, it’s time for investors to hit the books again in search of fresh drivers for a market that, despite new record highs this week, feels uneasy.\nSure, market gauges don’t obviously suggest jitters — but bear with me.\nVolatility nudged off lows during Thursday’s market slide, but with the Vix around 13, it is still extremely low. \nIf Wall Street’s fear gauge isn’t fearful, why should I think there are jitters out there? Take IPOs. Vix at 13 and stocks near record highs should in theory have tempted a steadier stream of companies to launch initial public offerings than we’ve seen in recent weeks. June and July have a heavier listings calendar, bankers say, but the fact that wannabe market darlings have held back during earnings season implies a degree of nervousness. \nIt’s not just stocks that look calm, either — bond volatility as measured by ICE’s MOVE index, below, is at its lowest since the Fed began raising rates. \nMOVE at these levels roughly implies daily changes in yields of 0.05 percentage points, down from about 0.08 percentage points last year. In bond world, that’s a return to something more normal, which should in theory help stocks by easing the risk of being whipsawed by outsized yield swings. Perhaps it’s a background support to stocks but even with the threat of interest rate rises receding, bonds don’t seem to have as much power to boost stocks as they did to hurt them last year.\nThen there are the overall earnings that have been reported. By a pre-Nvidia count from Bank of America strategists, on average, companies have beaten analyst expectations by 7 per cent. That’s the biggest gap, or beat, since the US was emerging from the pandemic.\nBut were those beats down to a great performance, or ground-down analysts having grown too gloomy? It might be more the latter. \nNine months back, Q1 earnings per share for S&P 500 stocks were expected to have risen 9 per cent year on year, according to JPMorgan. That was cut heavily as this season neared, only for companies to actually produce about 6 per cent in the end. So better than feared, but not enough, it seems, to instil investors with fresh confidence.\nEarly last month, Rob wondered in this newsletter why analysts weren’t being more bullish given the unexpectedly strong economy. He feared it was because their bottom-up models factored in potential nasties that were hidden by a more general, macro view of corporate profitability. \nThe way stocks are trading, he’s not alone in wondering what lurks beneath.\nThere’s always a point when the pain in a trade switches from the longs to the shorts. Not many people predicted anything good from China this year. Yet the Hang Seng China Enterprises index is up 16 per cent this year matching Japan, an international market darling. That makes the world’s second-largest economy and second-largest market harder to ignore.\nIs this the year of the particularly auspicious fire dragon writ large? Or a large, dead cat bouncing? \nSitting in New York as presidential election campaigns gear up, it’s hard to feel fired up. Last week’s decision by President Joe Biden to slap an additional $18bn of tariffs on Chinese goods reignited debate over whether Washington was “de-risking” (the administration’s phrase) its relationship with its rival, or targeting a harsher economic decoupling. \n“It’s about the risk you want,” says one senior investment banker. “If you have growth in the US and a bounceback under way in Europe and Japan, why put money in China with so much geopolitical risk?”\nFor those who can stomach the political angle, it also depends on how you want to measure Chinese performance. The HSCEI, which tracks mainland companies listed in Hong Kong, is a handy gauge of international sentiment towards China. Its also a better reason to write about China than the mainland blue-chip CSI 300 (pink line), which is lagging Europe (brown) for performance this year. \nHistory suggests there’s more to come in the HSCEI’s rally. HSBC’s head of Asia-Pacific equity strategy, Herald van der Linde, counts 12 occasions since 2000 when the index has gained 30 per cent in less than five months — and then added another 27 per cent on average over the following four months. \nInterestingly, the HSCEI is outperforming the MSCI China, which is so often the index of choice for international investors. Since the latter is made up of Chinese listings in Hong Kong and New York as well as the mainland, its heavy with tech and internet names and views on those are mixed. \nWhat are doing particularly well however, are Chinese banks, and that’s unusual. China’s lenders have long been seen as sluggish state-directed institutions. Despite the rally, not one of its four mega-banks is valued at 60 per cent of its year-end forecast book value (HSBC: 93 per cent, for reference). \nYet JPMorgan strategists this week ranked China Financials number two in terms of sectors enjoying increases in long-only investor allocations this year in Asia, outside Japan (Korean tech topped that ranking).\nThe brown line shows mainland bank stocks, which have been relatively steady gainers — particularly compared with the troubled property sector (grey) with which they’re entangled. But the standout is the Stock Connect banks index (green) — that is, Chinese bank stocks in Hong Kong that mainlanders can buy via the system that links Hong Kong with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges. \nBetting on Chinese banks is a bold trade when Beijing’s new measures announced last week to end a years-long property slump were met with shrugs. Geopolitics are also limiting international investor interest in the country as a whole. \n“Think of it as CCP (Chinese Communist party) credit risk with a 6 per cent dividend yield,” advises one Hong Kong financier. \nIf mainland money is getting interested in yieldy bank stocks, that could go some way to pushing the market higher for others prepared to take the risk.\nDemographic problems are more widespread, and deeper, than many think. \nCan’t get enough of Unhedged?

        "Title": "Good Kitty or bad Kitty?",
        "Author": "Robert Armstrong",
        "Content": "Good morning. By Thursday, we are all likely to feel differently about the state of the economy and the outlook for markets than we do right now. The biggest reason is that we have a consumer price index inflation report on Wednesday. But that is not the only reason. Today, we have Home Depot earnings, and Walmart comes Thursday — two of the most important corporate barometers of the US consumer. Throw in Jay Powell speaking in Amsterdam today, producer prices, retail sales, and housing starts, and you have an information-rich week. Send your predictions to: robert.armstrong@ft.com.\nRoaring Kitty, also known as Keith Gill, tweeted a picture of a man leaning forward on Sunday night. Gill had a lot to do with the impressive, amusing, and irrational run-up in GameStop and other meme stocks in 2021. There was a quite good if basically deceptive film about him last year. He had more or less disappeared until Sunday. And so, naturally, GameStop shares were up 75 per cent, or about $4bn, yesterday. Other meme stocks (AMC, BlackBerry, et al) went bananas, too.\nObviously this is a very stupid thing to happen, but the stock market is full of very stupid things which active investors have little choice but to pay attention to.\nThe first thing to say is that while yesterday’s move in GameStop is stupid — in a world full of approximately rational people, the meme stock saga never would have even gotten started — it still makes sense, in the sense of being explicable. Gill and his retail army moved stocks before. They could perfectly well do it again. Almost a third of GameStop’s shares were sold short before the Gill tweet, so there was probably a huge short squeeze that explains a lot of the upward move, and short squeezes are normal, well-understood stock market happenings. (Though it should be said that joining a crowded short position in a smallish stock that is famous for squeezing out shorts, and which is a known plaything of sentiment, is an enormously stupid thing in itself. Why would someone do this? Did they not see the movie?).\nThe second thing to say, or rather to ask, is whether the extreme reaction to what might or might not be the return of Roaring Kitty (suppose someone just hacked his account?) reflects about market sentiment. Are we back in summer 2021-style euphoria? \nThe answer seems to be: no, but we are not a million miles away.\nUnhedged’s favourite blended measure of sentiment, Citi’s Levkovich index, incorporates a bunch of stuff such as the margin debt, the put/call ratio, and short interest. It remains well below the glue-huffing levels of 2021, but it is not far short of the level Citi designates as euphoric. Citi’s chart:\nTurning to individual investor sentiment, below is the American Association of Individual Investors survey (which is one component of the Levkovich). The weekly reading has come off of recent highs, but looking at the smoothed three-month average, we are about as high as the measure has gotten in the past few decades.\nThe strong sentiment might concern me more if the market, other than yesterday’s meme stock revival, was acting otherwise crazy. But, while valuations and prices are uncomfortably high, signs of insanity are hard to come by. Utilities do not outperform in totally crazy markets, as they have in the past three months. Of the big artificial intelligence-hype stocks, only Nvidia is crushing the market. Microsoft, Google and Amazon are performing merely solidly this year.\nAnother interesting counterpoint is consumer (as opposed to investor) sentiment. It has never recovered from the pandemic, and while it was trending up recently, it took a dive in May for reasons that are unclear — petrol prices are trending down, the stock market is OK, and inflation hasn’t gotten suddenly worse in the last month. Commentators are pointing to a mishmash of causes: war in the Middle East, campus protests, cows with bird flu, and so on. \nThe decline could just be noise. But assume it’s not. It would be slightly odd if we entered into a euphoric period for markets while consumers were down in the dumps (even back in 2021, when Roaring Kitty was last in his pomp, consumer sentiment was on the rise). It would be nice if cultural malaise was, if nothing else, a prophylactic against irrational exuberance in markets.\nIf you were looking for signs of insanity in the market, you might try looking at corporate bonds. Here is a chart from Michael Hartnett’s team at Bank of America. It is the ratio of total return indices for US triple A corporate bonds and long-dated Treasuries. Holy crow:\nCorporates’ outperformance of Treasuries since the early days of the pandemic is uninterrupted and historically unprecedented. Hartnett calls it the “long corporations, short government” trade. One might be tempted to frame this in terms of declining sovereign credit quality, as US deficits explode, while the balance sheets of the strongest US companies grow ever stronger. The idea of that framing would be that, in a worst-case scenario, the spread between riskless but over-issued Treasuries and scarce high-quality corporate bonds could disappear or even go negative.\nAnother, less-apocalyptic explanation of investment-grade spreads is simple demand. The return of Treasury yields that are quite high in both nominal and real terms has led to a surge in investor flows into fixed income generally. And there is a powerful logic for picking up a few extra basis points of yield (less than 40, at present, for triple A bonds) by buying corporates rather than Treasuries. The tight spreads will only widen meaningfully if recession risk — which now feels very remote — rises. And if that happens, interest rates will probably fall, offsetting the pain from wider spreads. Of course there are ways the trade could go wrong (stagflation, anyone?). But the bond market only sees one thing right now: all-in yields on corporate bonds that are higher than they have been in a long, long time.\nMore babies please.\nCan’t get enough of Unhedged?

        "Title": "The Baillie Gifford boycott does more harm than good",
        "Author": "John Gapper",
        "Content": "As readers and fans gather at Hay Festival this weekend to listen to writers including Paul Lynch, David Olusoga and Isabella Hammad, they will be in the midst of a maelstrom. Hay suspended its sponsorship from the asset manager Baillie Gifford after protests and the Edinburgh International Book Festival ended its partnership reluctantly on Thursday. \nBoth festivals were targeted by activists because Baillie Gifford invests some client money in oil and gas companies, along with others they accuse of being linked with Israel’s war in Gaza. “If the art world continues to take this dirty money, we all become complicit,” declared the singer-songwriter Charlotte Church, who boycotted Hay along with the comedian Nish Kumar.\nBaillie Gifford sounds like a shady outfit, if one takes at face value how it is portrayed by the pressure group Fossil Free Books. Only by making it divest or ceasing to accept its sponsorship would festivals it supports (along with the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction) help to create “a literary industry free from fossil fuels, genocide and colonial violence”, the group claimed.\nBut let us read the fine print. Baillie Gifford is an asset manager that invests money from pension funds and others in 1,000 companies around the world. They include Google’s parent Alphabet, Amazon and Nvidia, the ones allegedly tied to Israel. Nvidia, for example, has been singled out because its artificial intelligence chips have military as well as civil applications.\nWait one minute. On that basis, I have links to “genocide and colonial violence” because I also invest in Alphabet, Amazon and Nvidia thanks to having savings in global index-tracking funds. Since they are among the world’s most valuable companies, so do many FT readers through pension schemes that delegate investment to asset managers such as Baillie Gifford.\nBaillie Gifford specialises in investing in technology and growth companies. It has grown by taking big bets on transformative ventures, including those involved in the energy transition such as Tesla and Northvolt. As a result, it invests far less in fossil fuel-related companies than rivals: just 2 per cent of its £225bn assets under management, well below the 11 per cent sector average.\nSuch progress is not enough for activists, which raises the question of what sponsors they would deem acceptable. The energy sector is largely ruled out, as is pretty much any bank or financial institution. They do not appear to grasp that Norway’s Pension Fund Global, which they contrast approvingly with Baillie Gifford, is one of the world’s largest investors in the very same US technology companies.\nOnce you adopt a six-degrees-of-separation approach to divestment, it is hard to endorse anyone. Fossil Free Books welcomes public arts funding, but Arts Council England is largely financed by the UK government, which holds a golden share in BAE Systems, which is involved in producing the F-35 jet, as used by Israel’s air force. We can all conjure up tenuous connections.\nOther arts institutions rely on sponsorships that would now be impossible for festivals to accept. The Tate has partnerships with Bank of America, BNP Paribas and BMW. Literary festivals are unusually vulnerable to authors being subjected to intense emotional pressure to withdraw abruptly from their programmes and blowing a hole in their ticket revenues.\nIt is strange for authors to boycott them because of one sponsor’s tangential link to Israel through Amazon, when the company is responsible for many print and ebook sales. To be consistent and to have skin in the game, shouldn’t they ask publishers to remove their titles from Amazon, and take a pay cut for the cause?\nI put this question to Fossil Free Books, a mostly anonymous collective that communicates via Alphabet’s Gmail. The answer was no. “For us, this is a case of strategy, not of moral purity,” the writer Yara Rodrigues Fowler replied on its behalf. That is too slippery for my taste: it is clearly easier for protesters to demand that festivals lose money than to do so personally.\nBut the boycott’s biggest problem is not its shallow logic or its elements of hypocrisy: it is that the campaign causes harm in the guise of doing good. Baillie Gifford is not free to shed investments unless its clients instruct it, and another institution would buy them if it did. The chances of Israel being influenced by a UK literary boycott are remote.\nThe sponsorship that Church dismissed as “artwashing and greenwashing” has helped to support a fragile literary community, including free visits by school students to festivals. I do not imagine many companies will be eager to run a gauntlet of scornful and semi-informed authors to fill the gap. Corporate backing for literary events will decline further, while public funding is squeezed.\nIt is a cold world out there for many writers, so it is sad that they have been so easily manipulated by a group of activists into making it financially colder. Unless they are brave enough to resist this campaign of self-destruction, they can only blame themselves.\njohn.gapper@ft.com",

        "Content": "Dear reader,\nEvery business journalist holds a special affection for certain sectors or companies that they covered at important moments in their career. (The reverse is also true: I covered investment banks for this column in New York in 2008 and 2009. Enough said.)\nCommercial property is one of those sectors for me, thanks to a couple of years as a young reporter roaming the UK writing about the sheds market in various regions. Sheds — or old-school warehousing — have been reinvented as the modern logistics space. The next big thing is data centres. Lex recently took a look at three different aspects of the data centre and artificial intelligence boom:\nThe European industrial real estate market has barely recovered from the leasing frenzy for last-mile logistics space during the ecommerce boom of the pandemic. AI-driven demand for data centres looks like being the next one. Limited supply of data centres in key low data latency (low delay) hub locations — and in effect unconstrained demands — should translate into pricing power for landlords. Rental growth is expected to be twice that of any other sector. Read more here.\nThe big US tech companies are behind this surge in demand. They are taking a capital-intensive bet on AI in their rush to fill rural America with vast, windowless data centres. The result is large increases in capital expenditure, which will show up in rising depreciation in years to come. For now, profit margins are holding up, helped by cost-cutting and companies extending the expected life of equipment. But these tech groups need AI services revenues, not cost cuts, to fuel the data centre boom. Find out more.\nThere will be knock-on effects to all this spending. The energy requirements of data centres are vast, growing quickly and have a tendency to cluster in locations where utilities and grids are already stretched. The danger is more gas-fired power plants to feed this data beast. The tech giants, however, are rich, innovative and keen to curry favour with the public. Their appetite for renewable energy will only grow — and could help spark a renaissance for other sources of reliable clean electricity. Note that Microsoft now has a director of nuclear technologies. Read more here.\nIn Lex this week\nWhy are the City’s top law firms falling over themselves to raise pay rates for newly qualified lawyers? The fact that US firms — with their higher fees, longer hours and smaller teams — are on the offensive in London, growing aggressively and poaching staff, is part of the story. But the “totemic” standing of the NQ rate, as proxy for firm quality, is also important here. And efforts to narrow that gap between top NQ rates in London and New York could have knock-on effects for the blue-chip law firms in the City market.

Authentic Brands Group bought the storied but downtrodden magazine in 2019, aiming to turn it into a lifestyle brand.

Today the sector is underperforming in a period when the Japanese stock market is trading near record highs. Economic weakness in China, a key market for companies such as Shiseido and Kao, is one reason. Longer term, Japanese brands’ share of spending may not recover: Chinese shoppers, as in the luxury market, have increasingly been turning to homegrown brands.

Approval is desperately needed by Gazprom, which recently announced its biggest loss in decades as gas sales to Europe plummeted, leaving its business model in tatters. The Russian state-run monopoly has been one of the war’s biggest corporate casualties and with Europe having greater success than expected in diversifying away from Russian energy, it faces an uncertain future.\nGeopolitical tensions are also reshaping investment strategies in China. As western multinationals and politicians try to break their dependence on the country and limit its role in supplying critical products, Chinese manufacturers are building their presence overseas in countries such as Vietnam and Mexico that offer alternative supply chain routes into the US. The process is likely to gather speed after US President Joe Biden announced fresh tariffs on $18bn-worth of Chinese goods.

The EU, burnt by its near-total loss of solar manufacturing industry to Chinese competitors, is keen to avoid other sectors such as wind and hydrogen facing the same fate.\nEurope and the US meanwhile are still concerned about China’s support for Russia’s war and specifically its supply of dual-use technology, the latest flashpoint being an attempt by a Chinese trade body to buy drone-jamming equipment for Russian buyers.\nUS deputy Treasury secretary Wally Adeyemo said on Friday that the US and Europe “must make the choice stark” for China. “Chinese firms can either do business in our economies or they can equip Russia’s war machine with dual-use goods,” he added. “They cannot do both.”\nNew data revealed that a small group of the UK’s wealthiest estates were able to shelter £1.8bn of assets from inheritance tax in 2020-21, reigniting a debate over which types of businesses should receive lucrative relief from the levy. \nCampaigning in the UK’s general election continued apace with the ruling Conservatives focusing on issues around gender and the opposition Labour party on defence ahead of a televised leaders’ debate tomorrow.

        "Title": "UAE seeks ‘marriage’ with US over artificial intelligence deals",
        "Author": "Chloe Cornish in Abu Dhabi",
        "Content": "The United Arab Emirates is seeking a “marriage” with the US over artificial intelligence as the Gulf state hopes to use its oil wealth to become a global superpower in developing the cutting-edge technology.The UAE’s AI minister Omar Sultan Al Olama told the Financial Times that a recent deal with Microsoft to acquire a $1.5bn stake in Abu Dhabi’s commercial AI champion G42 was only the start of greater tech collaboration between the two countries.\nThat deal, which followed months of negotiations between US and UAE officials, led to G42’s promise that it would dump Chinese systems as the US seeks to maintain dominance over AI.\n“Now you’re going to see the outcomes of that marriage, if I may use that word, between both G42 and Microsoft, but also the UAE and the United States,” said Al Olama. “When you look at the frontier technology, at the most cutting edge, that needs to be in co-ordination with the US players and there needs to be reassurances that are given to the US.”\nFuelled by sovereign wealth funds worth about $2tn, the UAE’s AI ambitions have emerged into sharper focus this year as it tries to lower its economic dependence on fossil fuels in part by positioning itself as a global AI hub.\nAbu Dhabi has created the investment vehicle MGX, expected to be worth billions of dollars, chaired by the UAE’s powerful national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan. MGX has been in talks with San Francisco-based OpenAI over its chip development plans, the Financial Times has reported, and Sheikh Tahnoon has spearheaded discussions between the UAE and US on AI.\nThe UAE is building AI capabilities in key sectors from healthcare to defence and believes that AI can help its biggest enterprises become more efficient. Abu Dhabi’s national oil company said the use of AI-tools helped to generate $500mn in cost savings last year through increasing production capacity and making operations more streamlined.\nThe UAE is up against stiff global competition. The US and China are battling to take a technological lead over AI, while start-ups in the UK, France and across Asia are attracting multibillion-dollar investment from international investors.However, the UAE’s advantage is being able to provide unparalleled access to capital. Expectations that Abu Dhabi will invest heavily in AI projects overseas has also attracted industry leaders to the nation in recent months, from OpenAI’s Sam Altman to Nvidia’s Jensen Huang.\nThe UAE has stockpiled chips needed to power large language models, with Al Olama estimating the country had amassed a backlog that would serve its needs for two years. However, US officials are also seeking to slow the shipment of some AI chips to the Middle East, including the UAE, according to Bloomberg.\nSome observers worry about the autocratic UAE having access to advanced AI technology.\nMarietje Schaake, international policy fellow at Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, said US policy around AI had so far been pragmatic, narrowly focused on combating China. \n“The singular focus on China means other countries can claim to be part of a like-minded coalition, and the US administration gladly turns a blind eye to their human rights violations in the meantime,” said the former European parliament member.\nThis month, Abu Dhabi’s Advanced Technology Research Council released its latest large language model, Falcon 2, which it said has been assessed by outside evaluators as performing as well or better than rival LLMs made by Meta and Google.\nATRC has also spun out a commercial AI company, AI71, to build models based on UAE government data from health authorities and the judicial system.\nThe government data gives the UAE a “very strong critical advantage in this game, where there are very few players that have a lot of proprietary data”, said Faisal Al Bannai, ATRC’s secretary-general.\nRecommended\nAbu Dhabi also opened Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, the world’s first AI dedicated university, in 2019.\nThe institute has helped establish a pipeline for talent in the UAE, a major challenge for the country of only 10mn, most of whom are expats. Though a fifth of the university’s graduate students are from the UAE, 22.5 per cent are from China, said the university’s provost Tim Baldwin. \nWhile Abu Dhabi focuses on building AI technologies, its neighbouring emirate Dubai wants to apply them.\nDubai plans to increase its data centre capacities to host the cloud computing needed for AI and wants to foster AI “clusters” of companies around established industries such as finance.\n“There is a belief, across all of the leadership levels in the UAE, that AI is a technology that we are going to focus on,” said Al Olama. “The decisions we take today [ . . .] are going to shape how the UAE is for future generations.”",

        "Author": "Michael Acton in San Francisco and Nicholas Megaw in New York",
        "Content": "Nvidia’s market value rose past $3tn to overtake Apple on Wednesday as the world’s second-most valuable company, following a year of incredible growth driven by demand for its artificial intelligence chips.\nThe US chip designer’s shares rose about 5 per cent to push its market capitalisation ahead of Apple for the first time — ending the day at $3.01tn, according to Bloomberg data, marginally ahead of Apple’s $3tn. The iPhone-maker lost its spot as the most valuable listed company to Microsoft earlier this year. \nInvestors have flocked to Nvidia’s stock as tech groups such as Google, Microsoft and Meta spend billions of dollars on its chips, with no indication that their spending spree will slow in the near future.\nNvidia’s data centre chips power the AI models that chief executive Jensen Huang has claimed will spur a new “industrial revolution”, transforming global business with productivity-enhancing features.\nThe company delivered another blockbuster earnings report in May, with revenues up 262 per cent year on year, thanks largely to sales of its current generation “Hopper” chips. It also announced a 10-for-one stock split, which goes into effect on June 7.\nNvidia has single-handedly driven more than a third of the gains this year in Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index, according to Bloomberg data, raising fears in some quarters of an unsustainable bubble. The S&P 500 rose 1.2 per cent on Wednesday and is up 12.3 per cent year to date.\nStill, Nvidia’s bumper earnings and repeated upgrades to forecasts mean the company’s valuation is not at an all-time high when measured as a ratio of either its historic or expected profits.\nOn Wednesday it was valued at about 42 times its expected earnings over the next 12 months. That is up from about 23 times forward earnings at the start of the year and is well above Apple’s 29x — although that is below the peak it hit during the height of the first wave of AI euphoria last year.\n“The benefit they have is they’re one of very few companies that can actually prove AI revenues,” said Stuart Kaiser, head of US equity trading strategy at Citigroup. “The higher [the stock] gets and the further you get into this revenue cycle the more the risks increase, but so far it looks pretty clean.”\nDespite moves by rivals such as AMD and Intel to capture some of Nvidia’s market share, it remains the undisputed leader in the global technology race to offer the most advanced hardware for increasingly demanding AI workloads, as well as the software tools to build AI applications.\nHuang has promised a “one-year rhythm” of new chips, and unveiled Nvidia’s “Blackwell” products in March. Huang has said they would generate “a lot” of revenue this year — sooner than many analysts had forecast.\nAnd in a surprise move at Taiwan’s Computex conference over the weekend, Huang also teased the following generation of “Rubin” processors, which will start shipping in 2026.\nApple is holding its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10, where chief executive Tim Cook is expected to set out the company’s own plan for integrating generative AI features into its products.\nApple has so far been left out of the market hype around generative AI that has boosted shares of its rivals. Sales of its iPhones are also down year on year, partly due to resurgent competition in China.\nBut Cook has said he was “bullish” about its prospects in AI, and Apple’s shares have also recovered from a slump at the start of the year, with it announcing a larger than expected $110bn share buyback in May. \n\n",

        "Author": "ft",
        "Content": "For a generation, Intel’s best-known business partner was Microsoft. Now, however, it has formed a deep kinship with Wall Street. \nIntel announced on Tuesday that Apollo Global Management would lead an $11bn investment to create a semiconductor fabrication plant (fab) in Ireland. Just two years ago, it struck a similar deal with Brookfield to build a pair of fabs in Arizona. The Silicon Valley icon calls it a “smart capital” strategy where it lines up sophisticated outside investors to fund manufacturing where Intel remains in charge.\nThe A-rated company could sell bonds or stock to fund the capital buildout. Instead, the 51/49 joint venture targets a cost of capital owed to the Apollo group that lies between Intel’s debt and equity charges. Intel has made the bet that it can keep up with TSMC in the most advanced microprocessors and that the US company can also be a “foundry” for other chip designers.\nThe wager under chief executive Pat Gelsinger so far has a mixed record. Shares of Intel in 2024 are down — its market capitalisation is just $130bn — as it has largely missed the mania in artificial intelligence enjoyed by Nvidia. The latter’s market cap is now 22 times that of Intel. \nStill, Apollo and its co-investors have created a highly structured investment where its returns should achieve at least the high single digits with little risk of falling short. For Intel, it minimises its near-term cash obligations at a time when its profitability has been challenged. \nTrillions of dollars of private capital have been raised from sovereign wealth funds and large pensions. That comes at an opportune time when long-term, large-scale infrastructure projects in manufacturing, data centres, fibre, decarbonisation and electrification are about to accelerate. \nAn $11bn commitment might pale in size with the market value of Nvidia. But only a handful of companies like Apollo and Brookfield are able to benefit from deals such as the Intel joint ventures where multibillion-dollar cheques are merely table stakes.\nWhile the masters of the universe will probably do just fine thanks to the fine-print details they have negotiated, Intel shareholders should ask if growing chip manufacturing and production can be done efficiently enough to generate a positive return on their common equity. \nIntel has shown the ability to be creative in financial engineering. But its shares today are down slightly from when the original Brookfield deal was announced in 2022. The chipmaker says these deals are cheaper than using common equity, even though Intel’s equity cost of capital seems to keep going up.\nsujeet.indap@ft.com",

        "Title": "How an upstart is using its Nvidia ties to challenge cloud computing giants",
        "Author": "Tim Bradshaw in London",
        "Content": "An upstart challenger to cloud computing giants Amazon and Microsoft is using its alliance with Nvidia to turn artificial intelligence chips into a “new asset class” and raise billions of dollars. \nNew Jersey-based CoreWeave, which was founded in 2017 by former energy traders as a cryptocurrency miner, has raised $8.6bn in debt and equity over the past month to lift its valuation to $19bn. A year ago, Nvidia took a $100mn stake that valued it at $2bn. \nThe jump in price highlights how CoreWeave has become another beneficiary of the booming demand for AI chips that propelled Nvidia to a $2.8tn valuation and boosted the stocks of the chipmaker’s other partners such as Dell and Supermicro. Now the company is looking to put that capital to use by building facilities in the UK and Europe.\nCoreWeave rents out access to its coveted stash of Nvidia chips, including the in-demand H100 and the forthcoming B200, that run inside its data centres. Its facilities were designed to accommodate the particular requirements of high-performance computing, from high-speed networking between clusters of AI chips to liquid-cooled servers, said Michael Intrator, its chief executive.\nCoreWeave investors, including hedge fund Magnetar Capital, Blackstone and Coatue, are betting that soaring demand for specialised AI services will reshape the $500bn cloud computing market, despite the tens of billions that Big Tech companies are spending on their own data centres. \n“The way that the cloud is going to be used for the next generation is very different than how the cloud was used in its inception 20 years ago,” said Intrator, calling the company the Tesla to Big Tech’s Ford.\nIntrator said it was “incredibly hard” pitching to its earliest lenders, who had to become “experts in a field that they didn’t know anything about, to the point where they could lend billions of dollars and take it to their investment committee to propose a new asset class”, such as using Nvidia’s graphics processing units as collateral.\nCoreWeave had long since pivoted away from cryptocurrencies when the release of Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022 unleashed a huge wave of demand for AI computing.\nSeizing its opportunity, the company quickly scaled up its financing efforts. \nIt raised more than $420mn in the first half of 2023 in equity, then another $2.3bn in debt financing a few months later. Some existing shareholders sold $642mn worth of stock to Fidelity and others in December. Then last month it struck two more deals to raise $7.5bn in debt and $1.1bn in equity. \nCoreWeave needed the funding to “be able to scale large enough that we could support anybody who wanted to participate in the AI boom”, said Intrator, no matter how many thousands of chips they needed.\nNow CoreWeave has its sights on rapid expansion in Europe. It revealed plans on Wednesday to invest $2.2bn to build three data centres in Norway, Sweden and Spain by the end of next year. It has recently committed $1.3bn for two facilities in the UK, where it is basing its European headquarters.\nTo expand more quickly in the US, CoreWeave this week announced a partnership with Core Scientific, a bitcoin miner, to repurpose several of its data centres to host its GPUs. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that CoreWeave had also offered to buy Core Scientific outright for more than $1bn. The companies have not commented on the report. \nLike Amazon Web Services or Microsoft’s Azure, CoreWeave offers an alternative to companies buying and maintaining their own servers, offering flexible access to computing power. \nBut unlike AWS, which was founded in 2006 and can host an almost endless range of applications and data, CoreWeave’s data centre serves a specific niche of clients with extremely high-performance computing demands, from AI and drug researchers to media groups.\nDespite its reliance on Nvidia’s GPUs for the core of its service, Intrator argued there was a “misunderstanding” about CoreWeave’s relationship with the world’s most valuable chipmaker. “Nvidia is not giving us access to GPUs because they have some vested interest in us or because we have some advantageous access.” \nIts competitive edge was more than just having the right chips, Intrator said. For instance, CoreWeave had developed software that automatically manages and maintains clusters of GPUs. \nHe batted off questions about whether prospective investors were concerned about backing a business that had raised capital from Nvidia, only to spend a significant portion of those funds on that company’s products. \n“It’s such a crap narrative,” he said. “Nvidia invested $100mn. We’ve [raised] $12bn in debt and equity. It’s an inconsequential amount of money in the relative scale of the amount of infrastructure we’re buying.”\nNvidia also denied that companies it had invested in got preferential access to its new products. “We don’t help anybody jump the queue,” Mohamed Siddeek, head of Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, told the Financial Times last year.\nRecommended\nNonetheless, Intrator said that having Nvidia examine CoreWeave’s business and agree to invest was “an incredibly powerful tool” when it came to raising capital.\n“There’s an awful lot of questions that I’m able to answer based on the fact that the folks who do know more about this than anyone else are willing to put up massive amounts of capital behind what we’re doing,” he said.\nHe was able to convince lenders to stump up billions of dollars by leveraging a combination of its GPU assets, the value of long-term contracts signed with customers and a “proven ability to execute”, Intrator added.\nBy the end of 2024, CoreWeave would have 28 data centres across the US and Europe, with plans to create a “truly global footprint” over the next couple of years. “The company is continuing to scale as fast as possible,” Intrator said.",

        "Author": "Steve Johnson",
        "Content": "A US exchange traded fund issuer may have hit “peak 2024” with plans to launch 25 ETFs that would combine two of the hottest current trends: leveraged exposure and option-selling covered calls.\nNew York-based GraniteShares has filed to launch a family of “YieldBoost” ETFs, many of them based on single stocks, that would sell put options on leveraged ETFs — again many single-stock — issued by rival providers.\nThe ETFs would potentially benefit from significant option-writing premium income, but would combine a capped capital return with an uncapped downside risk from the underlying leveraged exposure.\n“I was shocked by the filing,” said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America at Morningstar, likening it to a “spaghetti cannon”.\n“Product development has gone down the path of throwing as much spaghetti at the wall as possible, then seeing what sticks,” Armour added.\n“Wow, this is peak 2024,” added Elisabeth Kashner, director of global fund analytics at FactSet.\nGraniteShares’ proposed ETFs would invest in a range of single assets, from individual stocks, such as each of the Magnificent Seven, to bitcoin, gold, volatility and a selection of stocks indices and sectors.\nThey would then sell put options on ETFs leveraged between 1.5 and 3 times issued by providers such as Direxion and ProShares. The collateral would be primarily invested in fixed-income instruments.  \nThe maximum gain would be the premium income earned from selling the options, plus “a limited amount of upside appreciation” up to the option’s strike price — assuming the underlying ETF rises in price to this level.\nHowever, investors would be fully exposed to any loss suffered by the underlying ETF — which could easily be chunky given its leveraged nature — only cushioned by the premium income, which is banked whatever happens.\nAs such, the proposed YieldBoost ETFs tap into two of the hottest trends in the US ETF market.\nOption-selling covered call ETFs have boomed in recent years, as epitomised by JPMorgan’s wildly popular Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), which has surged to $33.6bn in assets, rendering it the world’s most popular active ETF.\nUS-listed ETFs classified as “derivative income” by Morningstar Direct, which includes most covered call vehicles, hit a record $70.7bn in assets at the end of April, up from just $3bn at the end of 2020.\nLeveraged and inverse ETFs have also attracted more attention, even if their growth has not been as vertiginous, with total assets rising from $54.4bn at the end of 2020 to $94.9bn in April, according to Morningstar.  \n“Covered call ETFs have been one of the most popular trends in the past year, while single stock leverage ETFs have been some of the better-performing products in the same period,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, a consultancy, “so it’s not surprising that an asset manager wants to combine these in one product.”\nIn particular, Rosenbluth alluded to the success of NVDL, GraniteShares’ ETF offering 2x daily exposure to chipmaker Nvidia, which has returned 474 per cent since inception in December 2022 and currently holds $2.6bn.\n“Preying on the gambling mentality of investors paid off in a big way for GraniteShares with its leveraged single stock ETFs — most of which have struggled but the success of its 2x leveraged Nvidia ETF has earned it a solid payday,” said Armour.\n“That success footed the bill for the latest onslaught of YieldBoost ETFs.”\nWill Rhind, chief executive of GraniteShares, said “we have a customer base that is crying out for income”.\n“First and foremost this is an income product. It’s really an extension of some of the other income strategies that we have seen in the market over the past couple of years, from broad indices to single stocks.\n“It’s a very popular category because it has been able to deliver a yield that is not available from either traditional fixed income or dividend-paying stocks.”\nThe inherently volatile nature of the underlying ETFs means these YieldBoost might be able to generate more option income than other covered call strategies, though their structure also increases the probability of a significant fall in the price of the underlying asset.\n“Theoretically, the more volatility you have the more income you should be able to generate,” Rhind said. “There is plenty of demand for this.”\nFactSet’s Kashner, a former options trader, though, was unconvinced by the investment rationale for the YieldBoost ETFs.\n“The building block is geared exposure and most of the time investors who go into geared exposure are doing so because they believe the underlying is going up and they want more up,” she said.\n“I can’t understand the investment rationale behind this: ‘I think Meta is going to the moon but not too far to the moon’? You are only getting some of the up and you are giving up the dividends.”\n“What percentage of the investors will understand how these funds function and what the potential costs and benefits are?” Kashner asked, adding that with other covered call strategies such as JEPI “the number of investors who have put their money in it may not correspond to the number of investors who understand it”.\nArmour was more forthright still. “Investors in these ETFs may be shocked that these high-risk strategies come with limited upside, most of the downside, and lots of tax-inefficient income. Investors are best steering clear of them,” he said.\nIf the US Securities and Exchange Commission does not object to the filings, the ETFs could launch on August 7. Rhind said he expected fees to be in line with those for similar covered call ETFs, at about 70-100 basis points.",

        "Content": "Analyst angst is real. You spend years sweating over some of the world’s toughest exams, with the odds stacked against passing, only to discover a computer can do the job better.\nA draft paper found that generative artificial intelligence, which mimics (or in this case apparently exceeds) human ability, outperformed financial analysts when it came to predicting the direction of future earnings — and by a comfortable 8 percentage point margin too, said Alex Kim, Maximilian Muhn and Valeri Nikolaev of the University of Chicago.\nThe real surprise was that the large language model trounced its biped peers without recourse to all the context that informs earnings — sectoral issues and economic backdrop, say, or changes of personnel.\nInstead, it was simply fed stripped down and standardised balance sheets and income statements. Company names and years were anonymised: after all, even a basic model could crawl through news cuttings and “predict” that Nvidia will increase earnings this year. \nAnalysts, in contrast, have plenty to peruse in order to inform their decisions: earnings calls, management discussion and outlook as well as knowledge of the sector and the environment in which it is operating.\nChatGPT’s secret sauce is chain of thought reasoning. The model learns to do the maths — operating efficiency, leverage ratio — and identify trends. These become the building blocks to work out whether future earnings will rise or fall next year. \nCertainly, some of this is basic stuff. Even 19th-century calculators were capable of dividing numbers. Spotting trends is as easy as CMD-F: try plugging free cash flow into any number of tech newbies and check out all the negative numbers.\nYet ChatGPT’s record on the basis of slim pickings bodes well for a model furnished with more contextual data. Banks, hedge funds and wealth managers are already harnessing AI. Some fund managers are already incorporating genAI in investment decision making. Mostly, however, these complementary tools take over the grunt work: transcribing earnings calls, summarising data, analysing text, eliminating human error and saving copious amounts of time. \nSo analysts need not start packing their boxes yet. The model’s outperformance is not just a story of superior intelligence. The benchmark is the median forecasts: plenty of analysts do better.\nIn any case, as with most jobs, there will be room for humans alongside the machines. That at any rate is the view of the diplomatic ChatGPT, which concludes: “A hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both AI and human analysts often provides the most accurate and comprehensive forecasts.”\nlouise.lucas@ft.com",

        "Content": "Some high-powered knighthoods to start: Rishi Sunak put forward JPMorgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon and former Google chair Eric Schmidt for UK honours, people familiar with the matter said, as the British prime minister enters what may be his final weeks in office.\nIn today’s newsletter:\nSoftBank’s old adversary returns\nDe Beers chief’s diamond plan\nThe upstart benefiting from Nvidia ties\nSoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is having to deal with an old sparring partner once again: Elliott Management.\nThe US activist firm has built up a stake of more than $2bn in SoftBank and has been talking to senior management for the past few months in an effort to convince them to spend $15bn buying back their own shares.\nThe fund has swooped on SoftBank at a time when the gap between the combined value of the company’s assets and its market valuation has never been wider, hovering at around 50 per cent since October of last year.\nSon, meanwhile, is back on the offensive, planning to use SoftBank’s much improved balance sheet in his hunt for deals in artificial intelligence.\nHe has built his current growth strategy around a roughly 90 per cent stake in UK chip designer Arm, whose surging stock market price has lifted SoftBank’s net asset value to a record $180bn.\nWhile the conglomerate’s shares have risen by more than 50 per cent this year, its current market capitalisation stands at about $90bn.\nFor Elliott, that record discount represents an opportunity, both for SoftBank and for shareholders, and they want to see a large-scale buyback by the time August’s first-quarter earnings roll around.\nThe firm’s last investment in SoftBank involved building a stake of about $2.5bn in early 2020, when it had a similar focus on the discount. And SoftBank — whether in part due to Elliott’s pressure or not — did eventually buy back a lot of shares.\nIt feels significant that Son is due to speak at SoftBank’s AGM in a little over two weeks — he is expected to put some flesh on the bones of his plans to invest in AI and support Arm.\nThe question for Elliott and investors is whether he thinks he can put all of SoftBank’s capital to better use than buying back its own shares.\nSoftBank stock popped over 5 per cent on Wednesday after the FT’s story was published. That gives some sense of what investors think.\nSon, however, remains harder to scrutinise.\nEvery great love story has a beginning and middle, but no end.\nThis may be how De Beers markets its diamond engagement rings, but when it comes to its own romance with owner Anglo American, the love story seems to be winding down.\nJust two weeks after Anglo unveiled plans to sell or list the world’s biggest diamond producer by value, De Beers chief executive Al Cook, a former oilman at BP, outlined a five-year strategy to recut the diamond miner into a leading global luxury jewellery house, the FT’s Harry Dempsey reports.\nIt’s clear there’s a need for more than just a polish. Core earnings last year at $72mn were the lowest since the Oppenheimer family took the company private in 2001, as lab-grown diamonds cannibalised demand for stones dug out of the ground.\nThe growing popularity of factory-made diamonds robbed the natural stones of a whopping $7bn of jewellery sales in the US last year, according to De Beers’ estimates.\nA departure from Anglo — a shareholder since 1926 and majority owner since 2012 — would be a historic moment for the company. But the need for the diamond industry, led by De Beers, to grasp a future that lies “way beyond mining”, as Cook put it, has been clear for some time.\nThe diamond industry has been something of a bystander to the lab-grown threat, opting for denial over counteroffensive marketing campaigns.\nCrucial planks of Cook’s plan are to more than double De Beers Jewellery outlets — visible in the luxury districts of Bond Street and Madison Avenue — to 100 stores globally by the end of the decade.\nDe Beers will also partner with the likes of top jewellers such as Signet and Chow Tai Fook on marketing campaigns. Also helping De Beers’ ambition to capture more value for its diamonds is a ploy to also sell polished diamonds for the first time (besides the exceptionally valuable stones).\nA new owner, particularly a big name within luxury goods, would help De Beers go further in its desired strategic direction.\nBut analysts find it hard to imagine who would want to buy the diamond company, which suffers from being like its product: so unique that it’s hard to value.\nThe business receives a “vast variety” of valuations, says Cook, which he hopes to narrow down through more transparent reporting in the quarters ahead.\nThat would suggest to some that the route of an IPO is more likely with Anglo having a tried and tested model in spinning out thermal coal producer Thungela in 2021.\nAmazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure have long dominated cloud computing. But there’s a new player in town.\nNew Jersey-based CoreWeave, which was founded in 2017 and started off as a cryptocurrency miner, is slowly gaining a foothold in the white-hot cloud computing market. Its valuation reached $19bn after it raised $8.6bn in debt and equity last month, the FT’s Tim Bradshaw reports.\nThe secret to its success? Riding the AI wave — with some help from Nvidia.\nThe chipmaking behemoth took a $100mn stake in CoreWeave last year which valued the company at $2bn. Other investors include hedge fund Magnetar Capital, Blackstone and Coatue.\nNvidia has somewhat of a halo effect. Some of the chipmaker’s magic seems to rub off when a company teams up with the group, with other partners such as Dell and Supermicro having enjoyed similar knock-on effects.\nArmed with fresh capital, CoreWeave has set its sights far beyond Jersey’s borders. It’s looking to set up facilities in the UK and across Europe, and revealed plans on Wednesday to invest $2.2bn to build data centres in Norway, Sweden and Spain.\n(It’s also scaling up in the US in part through a new partnership with crypto miner Core Scientific.)\nThe company essentially rents out a coveted stash of Nvidia chips to businesses that need seriously powerful computing — such as high-speed networking between groups of AI chips to liquid-cooled servers.\nThe backbone of CoreWeave’s business is made up of Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs. But CoreWeave’s chief executive Michael Intrator argued its competitive edge is more than just the sought-after chips.\n“Nvidia is not giving us access to GPUs because they have some vested interest in us or because we have some advantageous access,” he said, adding the company has developed software that automatically manages and maintains the GPUs.\nBut are investors concerned by the idea of backing a business that had raised capital from Nvidia, only to spend a big chunk of those funds on that company’s products?\nIntrator shot down the question, insisting Nvidia’s $100mn is a drop in the bucket compared to the other capital it’s raised.\n“It’s such a crap narrative,” he said.\nAzura Partners has hired Pauline Cahill as its chief people officer as the firm plans to double its headcount in the next three years. She was previously co-head of global strategic recruitment at Credit Suisse.\nArini, the alternative asset manager founded by Hamza Lemssouguer, has hired Nabil Aquedim as head of real estate and asset-backed strategies. He previously worked at Goldman Sachs, most recently as a managing director.\nUnbridled growth For centuries, the world’s only gotten richer. A new book written up in the New Yorker, Growth: A History and Reckoning, delves into the costs of that much growth — and whether it should be reined in.\nHamptons nightclub The owner of a hot Manhattan-based members-only club is looking to open up an outpost in the Hamptons.

        "Title": "‘Most exciting moment’ since birth of WiFi: chipmakers hail arrival of AI PCs",
        "Author": "Eleanor Olcott in Taipei ",
        "Content": "The titans of the chip industry descended on Taiwan this week to lay claim to an “AI PC revolution” that promises the biggest advance in decades in how consumers and office workers interact with their personal devices. \nThe annual Computex conference has been the venue for an unprecedented gathering of the chief executives of Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm and Arm, who gave speeches featuring flashy AI-generated videos and publicity stunts to prove that their technology behind chips for artificial intelligence-enabled PCs — many of which are manufactured in Taiwan — was the most powerful and efficient.\nComputex was “the most vocal opportunity for each of the chipmakers to tell their own AI PC story”, said Ian Cutress, chip analyst at consultancy More Than Moore, ahead of what industry experts are forecasting will be a surge in demand for AI PCs in the coming months.\nThese notebook and desktop computers are embedded with specialised silicon to run AI applications such as digital assistants and software that can generate everything from code to videos on the device itself, rather than relying on cloud services.\n“When I think about the PC market, this is the most exciting moment in 25 years since the arrival of WiFi,” said Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, in a speech that also featured a chatbot saying its products were more price competitive than its rivals. Qualcomm chief Cristiano Amon went further, saying the PC industry was being reborn, with the AI PC the most important development since Microsoft’s Windows 95 operating system.\nMicrosoft kick-started the AI PC race when it unveiled a series of AI-enabled personal computers in May. The devices going on sale this month will be equipped with Copilot, Microsoft’s flagship AI assistant, and include a new “recall” tool that can rapidly retrieve what users have viewed on their machines by saving snapshots of their screens periodically.\nIt selected Qualcomm to be its first AI chip supplier, despite its Arm-based processors having a small fraction of PC sales in a Windows market traditionally dominated by Intel and AMD and their rival x86 architecture.\nAnalysts say Microsoft aims to encourage more competition. Cutress said Qualcomm was “more willing to be agile” to Microsoft’s technical demands in order to gain a foothold in PCs and diversify from its traditional domain of smartphones.\nQualcomm’s Amon hailed the collaboration as a “history” defining moment marrying its chip with Microsoft’s software to bring “a new era for the PC”. He said the company had “never got any credit as a computing company”.  \nBut Intel and AMD are not far behind in deploying their AI chips in PCs. AMD unveiled two new processors at Computex for AI PCs, which will start shipping in volume at the end of next month. Intel said it expected its Lunar Lake processor, a flagship chip targeting AI PCs, to ship in the third quarter, in time for the holiday buying season.\n“Considering their [Intel and AMD’s] decades-old close relationships with PC makers, I suspect that they would adapt the best to the AI PC market,” said Rakesh Kumar, professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\nThe rush to bring out products in Taipei for the “AI revolution” appeared designed to steal a march on Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference, which begins on Monday in Silicon Valley and is expected to debut a range of AI features for products powered by in-house chips. \nThe frenzied activity comes just as the PC market is recovering, with 3.2 per cent year-on-year growth in shipments in the first quarter, according to research group Canalys. There had been two years of weak sales following a boom from the shift to working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nMorgan Stanley analysts said AI PCs would be key contributors to the next leg of PC market growth as penetration rises from 2 per cent in 2024 to 65 per cent in 2028 and as companies opt for PCs that run AI applications on the device as a cheaper, more secure and flexible option than in the cloud.\nKumar said the PC market should also “watch out for Nvidia”, even though its main focus is now entrenching its lead in AI processors for data centres. Nvidia started out as a chipmaker for gaming PCs, but the AI boom has led to 87 per cent of its $26bn in sales coming from data centre products in the first quarter of this year.\nKumar said Nvidia could “leverage their GPU [graphics processing unit] advantage” to be “competitive in the AI PC market”. Microsoft has already announced that it will use its GPUs in future AI PCs. \nRecommended\nSmaller hardware makers are also piling into the new market, with dozens of consumer electronics manufacturers from Taiwan and China using Computex to showcase accessories altered to integrate AI software, including keyboards and headsets with special Copilot buttons to bring up the application.\nDespite the AI upgrade push, analysts question whether consumer demand will be strong enough to justify the higher price tags for more powerful hardware.\n“What drives people to upgrade their devices is increased productivity,” said Cutress. “Do these devices enable you to work faster? We’re at the point where the hardware is there. But we’re still yet to see whether there is software that can answer this question.”\nAdditional reporting by Camilla Hodgson in London",

        "Content": "Hello, this is Kenji in Hong Kong.\nThe mass candlelight vigil held on June 4 to commemorate those killed in the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown used to be one of the most popular annual events in the city. Despite the topic being taboo on the mainland, the vigil was allowed to continue even after the UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997. This was viewed as a symbol of the city’s freedom and a sign of the “one country, two systems” arrangement in action.\nBut the imposition of a national security law four years ago and comprehensive national security ordinance enacted this year have seen the centre of commemorations clearly shift to Taiwan.\nWhat many people may not remember is that “one country, two systems” — which China had promised to maintain in Hong Kong until 2047 — was originally devised by Deng Xiaoping in 1979 as a plan for the unification of Taiwan.\nTaiwan flatly rejected the idea, though it was not quite as far-fetched at the time as it might seem today. Both sides of the strait were governed by authoritarian, one-party regimes, with Taiwan under martial law and China emerging from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and embarking on reform and opening up.\nTiananmen was the pivotal moment. While Beijing crushed its student-led protest movement, Taipei responded peacefully to a similar incident the following year, paving the way for the island’s transformation into a full-fledged democracy.\nSince then, the trajectories of Hong Kong and Taiwan have continued to diverge, with the former moving closer to Beijing and losing much of its global hub status, while the latter has forged its own identity and become arguably Asia’s most important tech economy.\nThat divergence was on full display this week. While major news from Hong Kong focused on what has been lost, headlines from Taiwan were all about the future: the promise of AI and the next tech revolution.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang kicked off a busy week of tech news from Taiwan on Sunday with a keynote speech ahead of the Computex trade fair.\nHuang hinted his company will introduce a new version of its AI chips every year, write Nikkei Asia’s tech correspondents Cheng Ting-Fang and Lauly Li.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger was also at the event, telling reporters that the US chipmaker intends to “pursue exporting all of our products to China”, even as Washington clamps down on shipments of advanced chips and chipmaking tools to the country.\nAway from the thronged event, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co embarked on a new era as CC Wei took over as chair of the chip company on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters after his first annual general meeting in his new position, Wei said he was thinking about raising TSMC’s chip production fees for Nvidia given how “expensive” its products are.\nThe Saudi Arabian fund Prosperity7 has thrown its weight behind China’s most prominent generative artificial intelligence start-up, becoming the only foreign investor in the competitive race to find a domestic alternative to OpenAI, reports Eleanor Olcott for the Financial Times.\nProsperity7, part of state-owned oil group Aramco’s venture capital arm, was a minority investor in a roughly $400mn investment round in Beijing-based Zhipu AI. The financing round values the Chinese group at around $3bn.\nZhipu AI and its closest rivals — Moonshot AI, MiniMax and 01.ai — have been dependent on support from government funds and large local cloud providers.\nForeigners have stayed on the sidelines due to US restrictions and concerns about whether the industry can ever become profitable given the huge costs involved in training and running AI models.\nThe decision by Prosperity7, which manages a $3bn fund, to support Zhipu demonstrated a Saudi willingness to support an ecosystem that could guard against US dominance in AI.\nWhile democratic countries like the US and Japan announce government subsidies to specific chip companies, finding similar information for companies in China takes a bit more work.\nDigging into corporate data, Nikkei Asia’s Kenji Kawase found that for the first time CATL, China’s leading electric vehicle battery manufacturer, was the top recipient of state subsidies among all mainland listed companies last year. Since Xi Jinping rose to power in 2012, the two major state oil companies had dominated the top spots.\nThe latest figures reflect a shift in the government’s priority towards strategic tech sectors, especially in EV-related sectors, as four of the top 10 recipients, including CATL, were in this category.\nSecuring enough land in multiple locations to build base stations has long been one of the headaches of operating a mobile carrier. Relief, however, could be on the way, writes Nikkei’s Shiho Miyajima.\nJapan’s NTT DoCoMo plans to launch a fleet of aerial base stations developed by Airbus-owned Aalto HAPS in 2026. Soaring at an altitude of about 20 kilometres, these stations can send telecom signals over an area with a radius of up to 200km, compared to about 10km for a terrestrial base station. And unlike the low Earth orbit Starlink satellites launched by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, no specialised equipment is needed to connect to this platform.\nIf successful, NTT DoCoMo will be the first company in the world to use airborne stations in commercial applications.\nThe race for AI PCs: Who’s winning and what’s at stake (Nikkei Asia)\nChinese trade body seeks drone jammers for Russian buyers (FT)\nIndia outpacing Asian rivals in data centre capacity, report says (Nikkei Asia)\nChina’s army tests gun-toting version of robot dog (FT)\nSaudi games company wants to deepen Nintendo, Capcom ties (Nikkei Asia)\nPalau hit by cyber attack which ‘traces back to China’: President (Nikkei Asia)\nNetworks linked to Russia and China use OpenAI tools to spread disinformation (FT)\nJapan’s chip supply chain stocks are still a good way to tap AI trends (FT)\nChina’s Guangzhou to invest $1.4bn in flying car infrastructure (Nikkei Asia)\nUAE seeks ‘marriage’ with US over AI deals (FT)\n#techAsia is co-ordinated by Nikkei Asia’s Katherine Creel in Tokyo, with assistance from the FT tech desk in London. \nSign up here at Nikkei Asia to receive #techAsia each week.

        "Title": "Big Tech’s AI dealmaking needs ‘urgent’ scrutiny, says US antitrust enforcer",
        "Author": "Stephen Morris in San Francisco, Javier Espinoza in Brussels and Stefania Palma in Washington",
        "Content": "The top US antitrust enforcer will look “with urgency” at the artificial intelligence sector, following concerns that power over the transformative technology is being concentrated among a few deep-pocketed players.\nJonathan Kanter said in an interview with the Financial Times that he was examining “monopoly choke points and the competitive landscape” in AI, encompassing everything from computing power and the data used to train large language models, to cloud service providers, engineering talent and access to essential hardware such as graphics processing unit chips.\nRegulators are concerned that the nascent AI sector is “at the high-water mark of competition, not the floor” and must act “with urgency” to ensure that already dominant tech companies do not control the market, Kanter said.“Sometimes the most meaningful intervention is when the intervention is in real time,” he added. “The beauty of that is you can be less invasive.”\nKanter, now in his third year at the Department of Justice, has alongside the Federal Trade Commission spearheaded a tougher antitrust approach, suing tech groups such as Google and Apple for what the US government alleges are unfair monopolies in services including app stores, search engines and digital advertising. He has worked closely with the FTC’s chair Lina Khan.\nHe said regulators were looking at the generative AI sector and examining the competitive landscape in microchips.\nKanter said the GPUs needed to train LLMs had become a “scarce resource”. Nvidia dominates sales of the most advanced GPUs, and its market capitalisation surged past Apple’s on Wednesday to become the world’s second-most valuable listed company.\nThe DoJ and FTC have reached an agreement that will divide antitrust oversight of critical AI players, according to two people familiar with the matter. The DoJ will spearhead probes into Nvidia, while the FTC will oversee the assessment of Microsoft’s and OpenAI’s behaviour. \nThe FTC, DoJ and an Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the agreement, first reported by The New York Times. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nKanter pointed to government initiatives to boost domestic production, including the $39bn of incentives in the Chips Act, but added that antitrust regulators were looking at how chipmakers decide to allocate their most advanced products amid rampant demand.\n“One of the things to think through is conflict of interest, a thumb on the scale, because they fear enabling a competitor or are helping to prop up a customer,” Kanter said. “If decisions are being made that show companies are not caring about maximising profitability or generating shareholder value, but more looking at the competitive consequences” then that would be an issue.\nSince the sensation surrounding the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022, an arms race has broken out as companies rush to secure multibillion-dollar partnerships with some of the most promising AI companies and those building models and apps based on the technology.\nEmblematic of such deals is Microsoft’s $13bn investment in OpenAI, which came with rights to the start-up’s intellectual property and a share of its profits but stopped short of an outright acquisition. Nevertheless, the FTC as well as UK and EU competition watchdogs have said they will probe the relationship alongside Google and Amazon’s multibillion deals with rival Anthropic.\nIn March, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella hired Mustafa Suleyman, founder of another AI start-up called Inflection, and most of its 70-person staff to create a new consumer AI unit. Some industry observers saw the deal as a tactic to circumvent antitrust laws and escape a formal probe.\nMicrosoft and Inflection at the time stressed that the agreement was not an acquisition and that Inflection remains an independent company.\nRecommended\nThe FTC is now investigating whether Microsoft failed to properly report its deal with the start-up, according to someone familiar with the matter. The FTC declined to comment on the probe, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. A Microsoft spokesperson said it took its “legal obligations to report transactions . . . seriously and are confident that we have complied with those obligations”. \n“Acqui-hires are something that antitrust enforcers” will look at, Kanter said, while declining to comment on any specific transactions. “We’re not using stylistic or formalistic characteristics of how these companies [explain these deals]. What we look at are the market realities.\n“We are focused on the facts. If the form is different but the substance is the same, then we will not hesitate to act. We look at what are the raw materials to produce a product. Whether that’s steel or engineers, that fits within the traditional paradigm of what we care about.”\nMicrosoft has pushed back against accusations that it exerts unfair influence or de facto control through its investments and cloud computing services. It has also invested in France’s Mistral and ​​put $1.5bn into Abu Dhabi AI group G42.\n“The partnerships that we’re pursuing have demonstrably added competition to the marketplace,” the tech group’s president Brad Smith told the FT. “I might argue that Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI has created this new AI market” and without its help, the start-up “would not have been able to train or deploy its models”.\nAsked why Microsoft did not buy Inflection, he said: “We didn’t want to own the company. We wanted to hire some of the people who worked at the company.”\nAdditional reporting by Camilla Hodgson and Michael Acton",

        "Title": "US tech sector pressures Chinese venture capital to divest",
        "Author": "Eleanor Olcott in Beijing",
        "Content": "US venture capital firms are putting pressure on tech start-ups to cut ties with Chinese backers as they anticipate tighter controls on foreign ownership from Washington.\nIn one example, HeyGen, a generative artificial intelligence start-up that was founded in Shenzhen during the pandemic but has since moved to Los Angeles, asked its Chinese investors — IDG Capital, Baidu Ventures, Sequoia Capital’s former Chinese venture capital arm HongShan and ZhenFund — to sell shares to US counterparts, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.\nThe AI video start-up, co-founded by former Snap software engineer Joshua Xu, completed a funding round led by Silicon Valley’s Benchmark in March, during which early-stage Chinese investors dramatically reduced their stakes through sales to US VC firms, these people said.\nHongShan and HeyGen declined to comment. Benchmark, IDG Capital, Baidu Ventures and ZhenFund did not respond to requests for comment. \nUS investors and Xu wanted to “clean up the cap table”, meaning its list of backers, as Washington’s scrutiny of Chinese tech groups and cross-border investment intensifies, the people said.\nWashington announced a ban last year on some investment by US funds in China’s artificial intelligence sector, but it has not restricted Chinese minority investments in American tech companies to date.\nHeyGen’s US relocation means it can access cutting-edge AI chips, which can no longer be exported to China, and court higher-paying customers than in its home country. The start-up builds customised avatars for videos and counts Salesforce, Nvidia, Volvo and Amazon as customers, according to its website. The product is unavailable in China.\nLast November, HeyGen raised $5.6mn at a $75mn valuation in a funding round led by West Coast-based Conviction Partners, with the firm’s founder Sarah Guo taking over HongShan’s seat on HeyGen’s board.\nIn an interview with Forbes, Guo said the “geopolitical situation has changed dramatically over the past year and a half” and that Xu was “extremely decisive in saying we’re going to be very clear about our investor base, our user base, our data centres and not having government influence”.\nHeyGen is the first high-profile example of an increasingly common trend, according to multiple industry insiders, as US investors grow fearful of stricter rules barring Chinese investment in tech.\n“There are currently no rules preventing Chinese investors from taking minority stakes in US companies. But in tech and banking, many parties are implementing tighter controls than the rules require,” said Benjamin Kostrzewa, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells in Hong Kong. He added that Chinese ownership could hamper a company’s ability to sell to the US government.\nThe trend to push Chinese VC firms to divest or reduce ownership in US tech comes as they are facing difficulties with investments at home as well, with bankruptcies in once-booming sectors such as energy storage and battery technology.\nAn anaemic IPO market and sluggish economic growth are also helping to push early-stage investors to look to overseas markets for growth. \nMany large Chinese VC firms have deep networks in the US, where leading partners may have studied or worked, making it an ideal location for them and their portfolio companies to diversify outside their home country.\nRecommended\nNeil Shen, HongShan founding partner, has been behind some of the most successful Chinese tech investments, including Meituan, Alibaba, PDD Holdings, ByteDance and Shein.\nOver the past year, Shen has talked about investing in “Chinese founders overseas” who can leverage China’s huge pool of engineering talent and world-class supply chain to build companies internationally, according to multiple people familiar with his thinking. Shen raised $9bn across four funds in 2022, much of which HongShan has yet to deploy. A person close to the company said the HeyGen share sale was an “independent investment decision”.\nBut HeyGen highlights the challenges that HongShan and other Chinese VC firms face, particularly in the fast-growing field of AI, where talent and resources are concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area. \n“The most exciting companies in artificial intelligence are coming out of the US, but these companies are all rejecting Chinese investment,” said one Chinese venture capitalist.",

        "Title": "Private equity gets ‘low, low, low’ in Berlin",
        "Author": "Amelia Pollard",
        "Content": "One big acquittal to start: Mike Lynch, once one of the UK’s leading tech entrepreneurs, was acquitted of criminal charges by a jury in San Francisco on Thursday, capping a 12-year legal saga stemming from one of Silicon Valley’s biggest fraud cases.\nAnd an exclusive interview to start: The FT sat down with Jonathan Kanter, the top antitrust enforcer in the US, for an exclusive interview on how regulators are looking “with urgency” at the artificial intelligence sector. Among the targets: Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI.\nIn today’s newsletter:\nFlo Rida pops champagne at Berlin’s SuperReturn\nFund managers raise concerns over Shein IPO\nAlvarez & Marsal gears up to raid the Big Four\n“I’m spending my money, I’m out of control, somebody help me, she takin’ my bank roll,” sang the rapper Flo Rida from a stage in Berlin.\nThe private equity crowd in attendance could relate.\nLeaders of the buyout industry gathered in Berlin this week for the annual SuperReturn confab, which draws senior executives from the likes of Carlyle, KKR, Bain Capital, Silver Lake, Thoma Bravo and General Atlantic.\nThe evenings were filled with side events including after-hours drinks at the local zoo, canapés on river cruises, and Flo Rida’s performance at an old factory outside the city centre.\nBut top executives used daytime panels to deliver a tough message, DD’s Ivan Levingston reports from Berlin: After frenzied dealmaking in 2021 and 2022, private equity must brace for lower returns.\nHigher inflation, shaky valuations, geopolitical conflicts and an unpredictable macroeconomic outlook have all combined to damp the PE industry’s mood.\nThat’s also making it harder to raise new funds as buyout groups are slow to sell their trillions in assets so they can return cash to their backers.\nWhile last year’s event came at a more challenging time and was characterised by one fundraising adviser as an “Armageddon type of mood”, the latest edition was slightly more upbeat.\n“There is a little bit of momentum,” said Rebecca Burack, global head of Bain & Co’s private equity practice. But “it doesn’t yet feel like we’re humming”.\nPerhaps the toughest message came from Apollo co-president Scott Kleinman, who likened the crop of investments made in 2021 and 2022 to a “pig” in a “python” that must eventually be sold off.\nOne popular topic remained the boom in private credit, which has become one of the fastest-growing corners of the asset management industry.\nFresh off a $20bn private credit fundraise, Goldman Sachs asset and wealth management boss Marc Nachmann said a test awaited the industry in the coming years that would reveal poorer-performing investors.\n“Cycles will expose certain portfolios,” he said. “In the past 10-plus years as the private credit class has really grown up as much as it has, we haven’t really seen that dispersion.”\nSpeakers also discussed the growing use of the secondary market, where investors can trade existing stakes, as a way of monetising investments outside a traditional sale, and the challenges facing IPOs.\nIt wasn’t all shoptalk however. While there was no frenzy like last year’s appearance by Kim Kardashian, auditoriums were still packed to see legendary football manager Arsène Wenger and Abba member Björn Ulvaeus.\nAnd the performers Flo Rida and DJ Fatboy Slim did their best to enliven the crowd’s mood one evening.\nAttendees watched as Flo Rida poured champagne on his head and threw around fake cash, reliving the hits.\nLondon’s stock market has been in need of a morale boost recently.\nWhile fashion company Shein’s blockbuster flotation should be considered a coup for the exchange, it brings along a suite of concerns, especially amid a rise in funds embracing environmental, social and governance standards.\nThe group, which is headquartered in Singapore, was valued at $66bn in its last funding round — making it one of the biggest companies in recent memory to potentially list in the City.\nHowever, there’s some baggage. Top UK institutional investors warn allegations that the company uses forced labour would deter them from investing.\nThe reverberations from those accusations could be grave. One UK fund manager says the exchange could risk “collateral damage” from listing the company.\nHuman rights groups have claimed ethnic minorities are being subjected to forced labour in Shein’s cotton supply from Xinjiang, which the company has denied.\n“It’s a tricky one,” the UK fund manager said. Anyone with an ESG group wouldn’t be able to buy Shein’s shares, he added. “It smacks of desperation for the London Stock Exchange — they’ll take anything.”\nAnd it’s true: London’s stock exchange has been bleeding out recently. Not only have companies been looking across the Atlantic for higher valuations, but UK groups’ cheap valuations have made them prime takeover targets.\n(On Wednesday, Wood Group said it would enter into discussions with Sidara, which could lead to the engineering company losing its London listing.)\nLondon wasn’t even the company’s first choice. Just over six months ago, Shein filed preparatory work to list in the US, but the plans stalled because of concerns over its ties to Beijing.\nEven in the City, it’s not a done deal. It’s not certain the China Securities Regulatory Commission would approve a UK float.\nBig Four accounting groups in the US have faced a bit of a reckoning recently, with regulators increasing scrutiny and some of the firms’ strategic shifts falling short.\nBut a tumultuous moment for some, means opportunity for others. And consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal is circling like a predator.\nBryan Marsal, the firm’s co-founder, put it best: he said the group was “like a hungry dog outside a butcher’s shop window” as it saw an opportunity to capitalise on the upheaval and strategic uncertainty plaguing rivals.\nThe consulting giant is looking to poach “hundreds” of partners and staff from the major accounting firms, as it looks to expand beyond its speciality in private equity transactions to other mergers and acquisitions.\nThat raid has begun. The group on Thursday announced it had hired six senior deal advisers from KPMG, including the global head of its integration and separation practice, Preston Parker. He’ll run a new business in the US at A&M targeting M&A work.\nA&M has also been poaching Big Four staff outside the US, hiring five KPMG partners in Australia and the group’s UK corporate finance head. It also brought on a 40-strong transactions team from EY in China.\nThe Big Four — which includes KPMG, EY, Deloitte and PwC — have had a tough go of it recently. One big pain has been the heightened scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest between audit and consulting work. (EY tried last year to split itself completely in two, but the plan fell apart.)\nBeing conflicted out of deals has become a sticking point for some staff, and A&M wants to capitalise on that angst.\nMarsal predicts 2025 will be a big year for deal work: “We’re going to be ready to go and ready to rock.”\nThe London Stock Exchange Group has hired New York-based Pascal Boillat as its new chief operating officer. He joins from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and previously worked at Deutsche Bank.\nQXO, formerly known as SilverSun Technologies, named Brad Jacobs chair and chief executive after it closed a $1bn investment.\nBridgepoint Group has appointed Tim Score as chair of the group, where he will succeed the firm’s founder, William Jackson. Score most recently worked at British Land. \nBernard Arnault has appointed his son Frédéric Arnault as head of Financière Agache, one of the family holding companies controlling LVMH. He was recently named chief executive of LVMH Watches.\nMFA, the trade association for the global alternative asset management industry, has hired Rob Hailey as managing director and head of Emea government affairs. He joins from Bank of America where he led government affairs in the UK and Ireland.\nAltman’s rein Long before OpenAI, Sam Altman’s strongest skill was his ability to wield power, Bloomberg writes. That comes with its own set of dangers.\nFraud mystery What first appeared as a straightforward case of pandemic aid fraud has morphed into a drawn-out dispute that has ensnared JPMorgan and a tiny Virginia lender, Semafor reports.\nEnergy transition Texas natural-gas billionaire Danny Rice is making a big bet that a new decarbonising technology could help produce clean energy from natural gas, the WSJ reveals.\nCredit Suisse investors sue Switzerland in New York court (FT)\nTussle over Remington ammunition maker heats up as MNC increases offer (FT)\nUS news outlets turn to Fleet Street veterans as their troubles mount (FT)\nRobinhood agrees to buy Bitstamp crypto exchange for $200mn (FT)\nLSE chief pushes for big screen outside HQ to champion market successes (FT)\nDue Diligence is written by Arash Massoudi, Ivan Levingston, Ortenca Aliaj, William Louch and Robert Smith in London, James Fontanella-Khan, Sujeet Indap, Eric Platt, Antoine Gara, Amelia Pollard and Maria Heeter in New York, Kaye Wiggins in Hong Kong, George Hammond and Tabby Kinder in San Francisco, and Javier Espinoza in Brussels.

        "Title": "Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s ‘Napoleon’ sees the chip company soar",
        "Author": "Elaine Moore and Michael Acton ",
        "Content": "Jensen Huang’s entrance at this year’s Nvidia conference had all the trappings of a pop idol performing in their hometown. Demand was so high that some attendees abandoned overcrowded coaches and resorted to running through downtown San Jose to catch the chief executive’s speech. As they searched for empty seats in the 11,000-capacity arena, the music swelled. Huang walked forwards, dressed in his trademark black leather jacket, and joked: “I hope you realise this is not a concert.” \nOver the past 18 months, Huang’s bet on artificial intelligence chips and software has turned Nvidia into one of the most powerful companies in the world. This week its market value briefly rose above $3tn — only the third company in history to do so. \nHuang is on the cusp of becoming a household name, joining the likes of Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg as one of the few tech CEOs the public can recognise. But even Musk has never been filmed signing a woman’s top, as Huang was this week.  \nIf he seems to relish the attention, that’s because it has been a long time coming. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 at the age of 30 and has remained at the helm for more than three decades. At 61 he is one of the last remaining founder-CEOs in Big Tech.\n“Jensen is an absolutely singular brew of kindness, intensity, ambition and relentless determination,” says Patrick Collison, CEO and co-founder of payments company Stripe. “He is Napoleon reincarnated with a big heart and a passion for semiconductor wafers.”\nDemand for ever faster, more powerful chips has been compared to a global arms race, one that Nvidia is helping the US to win. But even the US is not immune to shortages. Supply is constrained by capacity at TSMC, the sole Taiwanese company that produces the cutting-edge Nvidia chips driving AI breakthroughs. \nNvidia chips are therefore regarded as a matter of national security. Meanwhile, antitrust enforcers are circling. This week, Jonathan Kanter, head of the US justice department’s antitrust division, told the Financial Times that regulators were looking at the competitive landscape of chips.\nNvidia’s CEO is unlikely to be surprised. In Huang lore, greatness can only come from suffering. Chris Gibson, chief executive of AI drug discovery firm Recursion, which Nvidia invested in last year, recalls him offering some bracing advice during their first meeting. “He said, ‘Every start-up is in a constant state of death.’ You are always fighting against death, and you are always fighting for relevance.” \nHuang attributes his resilience to his childhood. Born in Tainan in southern Taiwan in 1963, he arrived in the US at the age of nine and became the youngest boarder at a school in rural Kentucky. After graduating from high school early, he attended Oregon State University to study electrical engineering, where he met his wife, Lori. The pair then moved to Silicon Valley and found jobs in the booming semiconductor sector. \nThis was a time when venture capital was flowing, PC sales were flying and semiconductor companies were experimenting with outsourcing manufacturing to Taiwanese companies. Along with two friends, Huang hit on the idea of creating a company that specialised in designing computer chips able to render realistic 3D video game graphics. They named their start-up after the Latin for envy, invidia.\nThe early years were difficult. Only the success of the RIVA 128 graphics card, launched in 1997, saved the company from bankruptcy. Nvidia listed in 1999, shortly before the dotcom bubble burst. It went on to survive a share price crash in the financial crisis.\n“Building a company, and building Nvidia, turned out to be a million times harder than any of us expected it to be,” Huang told the Acquired podcast last year. “If we had realised the pain and suffering and just how vulnerable you’re going to feel and the challenges that you’re going to endure and the embarrassment and the shame and the list of all the things that go wrong, I don’t think anybody would start a company.” \nPart of Nvidia’s survival may come down to its unusual structure. Rene Haas, chief executive of UK chip designer Arm, worked there in the early 2010s and says Huang has built an organisation that prioritises projects over typical management hierarchies. This allows him to reach down to any layer of it to get the answers he needs. “It’s a very unique culture,” says Haas. “The benefit of that is transparency and speed. And I think that is one of the things that Nvidia is really, really good at. They move very, very fast, they’re very, very purposeful.”\nHuang sees the job of CEO as someone who works on the things that nobody else can or does. In 2006, Nvidia started developing CUDA, the software ecosystem that helped to expand the use of its graphics processing units beyond gaming. The advent of generative AI, which supercharged sales, validates that strategic shift. Nvidia has cornered a highly profitable market for the data centre chips that power the training and implementation of massive AI models used by companies such as OpenAI.\nDespite his length of tenure, no successor has been identified. And Nvidia’s product release schedule is still speeding up. Blackwell, a more powerful AI chip, has just launched but the next generation is already in the works. When the time comes, expect Huang to be the person on stage who announces its release.\nAdditional reporting by Tim Bradshaw\nelaine.moore@ft.com, michael.acton@ft.com",

        "Title": "Rene Haas: ‘Arm has the most ubiquitous computer architecture on the planet’",
        "Author": "Tim Bradshaw",
        "Content": "Rene Haas is chief executive of Arm, the chip designer behind the processors in 99 per cent of all smartphones. After being bought by SoftBank in 2016, the UK-headquartered company became last year’s biggest initial public offering, in a deal valuing it at $54.5bn on Nasdaq. Since then, Arm’s market capitalisation has nearly tripled to around $140bn, as it has been caught in the updraft of investor excitement about artificial intelligence. \nBased in Silicon Valley, Haas has worked in the industry for almost 40 years, including seven years at AI chipmaker Nvidia before joining Arm in 2013. Since becoming chief executive in 2022, he has pushed Arm to diversify further from its mobile phone roots into PCs, automotive and industrial components and, increasingly, servers — all underpinned by the same promise of power efficiency that has kept its technology at the heart of the iPhone. \nArm does not manufacture its own processors — though a recent report suggested that may soon change — instead licensing a growing array of designs to the biggest names in the tech industry, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Google, Samsung, Amazon, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. \nAfter Apple switched its Mac processors from Intel to its own Arm-based versions in 2020, Microsoft this year unveiled a series of Arm-powered Windows PCs, hailing a new era of the “AI PC”. \nIn this conversation with FT global technology correspondent Tim Bradshaw, Haas discusses the growing importance of software to chipmakers and how AI is changing the devices we use.\nTim Bradshaw: Microsoft has been making a big push with Arm-based Windows PCs in the past few weeks but this isn’t the first time Microsoft tried to make that switch. What’s different now compared with the failed efforts of the past, such as 2012’s Windows RT? \nRene Haas: I worked on the very first Windows on Arm PCs back in 2012. And a lot has changed since that time. One of the things that’s probably the biggest difference now is that virtually the entire application ecosystem is native to Arm — meaning that, not only is the performance going to be fantastic, but try to find an application that’s not going to run. If you go back 12 years when Windows on Arm kicked off, it was a completely different world in terms of local apps versus cloud, and Windows on Arm didn’t support a lot of popular applications [such as Apple’s iTunes and Google’s Chrome web browser]. That was a killer blow. \nFast forward to 2024, there’s no issue with application ecosystems. And what’s been proven on the Windows on Arm platforms as an extension of the other ecosystem, MacOS, is the experience is phenomenal, when we look at the battery life and the performance that the Macs have . . . It’s going to be a very different game this time. \nTB: And now with the extra sales pitch of ‘AI everywhere’. Where do you think we’re up to in finding the right applications for these new AI tools? \nRH: Talking about AI PCs, I think it’s very early. I think you have Copilot [Microsoft’s brand for products enhanced by AI assistants recently extended to its latest AI PCs] that has now been introduced. So the feature set that has been talked about, I think it’s going to start to take advantage of the underlying hardware. \nWe know there’s going to be some other [Windows AI PC] systems coming out in the upcoming years. So, while the first-generation systems are going to be interesting, the second generation systems are going to be even more [so]. And folks who bought the first ones are probably going to be a little bit green with envy when they see what the second ones look like. \nTB: Buying version one of any new product is just part of the risk/reward of being an early adopter. Are you an early adopter? What tech are you playing with right now?  \nRH: Whether it’s game consoles, whether it’s phones . . . I’m a very much an early adopter. I probably have every mobile phone in existence. I’m a big foldable phone guy. I think they’re great. Because they are small enough when folded to act like a mobile phone. But when you expand it out, you can look at spreadsheets, you can watch videos. It’s like a mini tablet.\nTB: It seems like we’re in another moment where people are experimenting with different form factors for consumer electronics, with folding phones and AI glasses. Have you tried any of those new AI wearables?\nRH: I have tried some of them. I do like the Meta Ray Ban augmented reality glasses. They’re stylish. The video quality is good. They are good sunglasses and they don’t feel bulky or weird. Me, personally, I don’t like something heavy on my head. So that’s why I like the Ray Bans and they have Arm inside, which is also what I like. \nTB: Do you see that becoming a big product category? Because we’ve been here before with Google Glass which — to say the least — was not successful.\nRH: I think augmented reality is still emerging in terms of the capabilities of that field. I think there’s a huge opportunity with holograms, with display technology. That is an area that is probably early days still in terms of being figured out. I think it’s a generational thing . . . I think a generation has to grow up being comfortable with wearing things for an extended amount of time. [So] it’s more of a niche item right now. \nWhether it’s game consoles, whether it’s phones . . . I’m a very much an early adopter. I probably have every mobile phone in existence. I’m a big foldable phone guy\nTB: All of these products, whether AI PCs or smart glasses, are part of a broader trend for moving from AI services that run in the cloud — like the ChatGPT app, which needs an internet connection to work — to systems that run on the “edge” [industry jargon essentially meaning people’s or companies’ own devices, like phones or factory equipment]. There’s much more competition here than in AI chips, where Nvidia totally dominates right now. Do you see the edge becoming a bigger opportunity for chipmakers than the cloud? \nRH: We are still in very early days in terms of AI workloads running everywhere. So to your point of, ‘what is an edge device?’ maybe the user would describe that as ‘not the cloud’. So what has to happen is the [AI] models . . . need to evolve. I think the models need to get a little bit smaller, a little bit more efficient to run in these other areas. \nWhere is Arm going to play? They’re all going to run through Arm because, first off, you have to have a CPU [central processing unit], which is table stakes and for any of these end devices, and the installed base is all Arm anyway. So the software ecosystem is going to look to optimise around Arm. \nWe’re showing some information at Computex [the trade event in Taiwan this week] around compute libraries that will essentially make it very, very easy to run these AI workloads on Arm CPUs. Developers, in the past, did not have access to the Arm CPU when they wanted to run an AI application. Arm will now be making these libraries available to developers. So they can write the application and it takes advantage of the hardware. It could run three times faster, four times faster, at the same power. \nTB: These libraries are part of the broader package of Arm products that you describe as the ‘compute subsystem’. This is a core part of Arm’s strategy now, to go beyond designing one single chip for customers to build on. Can you explain more about that — and why you’re doing it?\nRH: What really makes Arm unique is we have the most ubiquitous computer architecture on the planet. Our CPUs are in 30bn devices per year, almost 300bn in total. What we are finding is that the chips are becoming increasingly more difficult to build and it takes longer to build them . . . as you get to smaller transistors. \nSo how can Arm help? Let’s say, in a server, you might have 128 ARM CPUs. And with those 128 ARM CPUs, you have all of the [networking systems] that connect them together. You have a memory mapping system, you have a mesh network . . . Previously, the end customer would have to put all that stuff together and then build their chip. With compute subsystems, we put all that together for them. \nWe are in mobile phones, we are in PCs, we’re in automotive applications, we are in complex AI training, and we are in general-purpose server[s]. All of those are Arm CPUs [and] areas that we are going to do compute subsystems. So, over time, it’s going to be a very, very large part of our business. \nTB: One of your big new customer wins on the data centre side recently was Microsoft which is doing a new Arm-based CPU for its cloud called Cobalt. You’ve now got Amazon, Google, Microsoft — the three biggest cloud computing providers — all running Arm CPUs as part of their cloud platforms. When did that work start from your side to see that come to fruition? \nRH: We have been working on this for over 10 years. It’s been a tremendous amount of work [in which] two things had to come together. The CPUs had to get performant enough against the competition. They had to be very efficient. They had to be very high speed. And we had to have all the components around it. And then . . . the software ecosystem had to have everything required that you could just run the servers. So Linux distributions, like Red Hat and SuSE. We were working in parallel to have all the pieces of the software together. \nWhen you combine the software being ready with world-class products and power efficiency, you now have a compelling advantage in terms of the chip. Now, what makes it even more compelling is, by building a custom chip, you can essentially build a custom blade, a custom rack, and a custom server that’s very unique to what Microsoft is running with Azure or what Google is running in Google Cloud or AWS.\nTB: Power efficiency is a big part of Arm’s pitch over traditional server chipmakers like Intel and AMD. Microsoft said recently that it’s investing so fast in AI data centres that it’s looking like it might miss some of its climate targets. That must be a problem all the Big Tech companies are facing right now?\nRecommended\nRH: Oh, yes, it’s massive. Two things are going to accelerate Arm’s adoption in the cloud. One is just broadly, this power efficiency issue. And secondly, the fact that, on AI, we can greatly reduce power by this customisation. Just look at Nvidia. Nvidia built a chip called Grace Hopper and then they built a chip called Grace Blackwell. They are essentially replacing the Intel or AMD CPU with an Arm CPU, which is called Grace.\nTB: One Big Tech company that hasn’t announced an Arm-based chip in its data centres yet is Meta, Facebook’s owner. Its new chip for AI inference [the kind needed to deliver AI services rather than create them], called MTIA, is using an open-source alternative to Arm’s architecture called RISC-V . . . Are they using Arm in other ways or have they decided to go down a different path? \nRH: This MTIA chip is an accelerator. And that accelerator has to connect to a CPU. So it can connect to an ARM CPU, or it can connect to an Intel CPU. RISC-V is not interesting from a CPU standpoint, because it’s not running any key software . . . I’ll leave it to Meta to say whether they’re going to connect to Intel or Arm.\nTB: The analysts I speak to see big potential growth for RISC-V in areas like automotive, where Arm is also hoping to grow. Do you worry that RISC-V is starting to nibble at the edges? \nRH: Where I don’t see it nibbling anywhere is running key software applications. I think there’s a misunderstanding commonly between the RISC-V architecture as it applies to being a chip and when it’s really running [key] software. Because it’s all about the software. \nAnd, again, back to what makes Arm very unique: every mass popular application you can think of has been ported to and optimised for Arm. It takes a long, long time not only to get the software written, but ported and optimised. There’s no software anywhere for RISC-V in these places. None.\nTB: So, if not competition from RISC-V, what does keep you up at night?  \nIt took us 20 years to get to $1bn. It took us another 10 to get to $2bn. It took us two years to get to $3bn. And we’re looking to get to $4bn in one year\nRH: The things that I worry about are the stuff that’s inside my control. We have massive opportunity with all these compute subsystems. We have massive opportunity with growth in AI. We have massive opportunity to reduce power to go solve this issue relative to data centres. It’s just making sure that we can execute on the strategies we have, because we are at a magical time in our industry relative to the growth potential. \nTB: How much does being a public company keep you awake at night?\nRH: Generally speaking, it doesn’t change how I think about running the company because I don’t really think about the company from quarter to quarter. I think about the company from year to year. Most of my discussions that I have with our internal teams or engineers are about 2027, 2028. \nTB: Unfortunately, Wall Street does tend to look at things quarter by quarter. You’ve had a lot of stock-price volatility around your quarterly earnings reports. That’s not uncommon for a newly-listed company but do you think investors really understand the Arm business? \nRH: What I would say about the volatility is we’ve had three quarters of being a public company and each quarter was bigger than the last one. And each quarter that we talked about going forward was larger . . . we basically indicated that we see 20 per cent growth year on year and we see that continue for the next few years.\nWe achieved $3bn in revenue over this past year. It took us 20 years to get to $1bn. It took us, I think, another 10 to get to $2bn. It took us two years to get to $3bn. And we’re looking to get to $4bn in one year. So the trajectory is in the right place. \nWe have incredible visibility in terms of our business, [not only because] we get reports from our customers, but because our market share is so high.\nTB: Some investors worry about visibility in two parts of your business in particular. One of them is Apple, one of your biggest customers but which is famously not very open with its partners. The other is Arm China. You warned in your IPO prospectus of past problems obtaining “accurate information” from Arm China. What insight do you really have? \nRH: We have great insight with Apple. They’re a phenomenal partner for us. They have signed a long-term [contract] extension. They’re very committed to Arm.\nArm China, that’s our joint venture in China. They are essentially a distributor for us. So we have very good visibility in terms of how we work with partners there. With China, the issue that we’ve faced in terms of export control are no different from other [chip] companies. But, in general, I would say, with Arm China, things are going quite well. \nTB: How has being a public company changed your relationship with SoftBank and its chief executive, Masayoshi Son? They’re still a 90 per cent shareholder but you’re more out on your own now. How does that dynamic change? \nRH: I think it’s changed in the sense that, as a public company, we now have a board that has independent directors that represent shareholders. So all the things that we have to do from a governance standpoint, that’s a little bit different. I’d say we are certainly more independent in terms of how we think about the company, how we talk about the company. But SoftBank’s our largest shareholder, so obviously they have a big say in terms of things at the boardroom table. \nWith Masa, I would say the relationship is no different. We talk all the time. He’s a brilliant guy. I think he gets a little bit of a bad rap in the press. He’s a guy who started the company 40 years ago and is still running it. There’s a pretty small group of people who have done that kind of thing, and the company is still broadly successful. \nTB: How does Arm fit in with SoftBank’s broader strategic goals around AI? \nRecommended\nRH: Clearly, Masa is very bullish on all things AI and — given that it’s pretty hard to talk about an AI application that doesn’t bump into Arm — we’re at the centre of many of those things. For example, SoftBank made an investment into a UK company called Wayve, which is doing some amazing work in LLMs [large language models, the complex AI systems that sit behind applications such as ChatGPT] for full self-driving cars. It’s running on Arm. So there is an area where if Wayve does well, Arm does well.\nTB: Does that mean you’re going to move into making your own AI chips, as Nikkei reported recently? \nRH: I can’t give you anything on that one. I can’t comment.\nTB: Silicon Valley in general, and the chip industry in particular, is full of ‘frenemies’. Nvidia’s biggest customers are all making their own AI chips, for example. Where do you think you can, and can’t, compete with your customers? \nRH: I tend to think more about where can we add value and where is the industry going? Back to compute subsystems. When we kicked the idea off, this was a bit controversial because, by doing a full subsystem implementation, some customers might say, ‘Hey, that’s the kind of work I do. Arm, I don’t need to have your finished solution.’ Fast forward, we solve a lot of problems in terms of engineering overhead. We solve a lot of problems relative to time to market. We solve a lot of problems relative to broadening out Arm’s platforms. \nSo that’s an example of something that might be a frenemy kind of thing where people might look at it and say, ‘That’s my domain’. But I would say it’s worked out far better than we thought. Even the early customers who pushed back at it are adopting it. \nTB: Another example of a frenemy for Arm is Intel. At the same time as competing for a lot of Intel’s PC and server business, you’re actually getting closer to them on the foundry side. You were recently on stage at an Intel event — which some people who have been watching this industry for 30 years might have seen as a ‘hell freezing over’ kind of moment. What is the nature of that relationship exactly? \nRH: Yeah, that’s a great example of the world moving around. Intel, 10 years ago, probably saw it was very beneficial to see Arm as not a healthy competitor. Fast forward, Intel has a burgeoning business that is trying to grow around Intel Foundry. What does Intel Foundry need? They need volume. Well, who drives the most volume in terms of CPUs? It’s Arm. So they obviously see the size of that opportunity . . . They’ve taken a lot of money from the US government on the Chips Act and they need to put that money to work. I think working with Arm is going to be the fastest way they can do that. \nTB: We’ve talked a lot about AI in the abstract. What are the particular applications of AI that you’re most excited about personally? \nHow long does it take to develop a new drug? Ten years. That can be cut in half, it can be cut by two-thirds by using AI. That to me is incredibly exciting\nRH: A really simple AI application that I use is to remove people from photographs. I’ll take pictures of my kids, my grandkids, my friends, and someone will photobomb. And you can just clean that stuff up. With [Google Photos] Magic Eraser, you can do that. Crazy simple, but that’s AI. \nBut the areas that I personally find far more interesting are drug research and medical. A very simple example: You’re ill, you go to the pharmacy, they prescribe some medicine to you, and you look at the medicine and the side effects are as generic as it can be. That seems like something that, if the doctor knew my DNA genome sequence and would be able to map out exactly which drugs will give me what kind of reaction, knowing exactly my background and profile, that would be compelling. I was meeting this morning with somebody who’s in this industry and was asking that question. With AI, that’s probably three to four years away. \nAnother interesting example is drug research. How long does it take to develop a new drug? Ten years. That can be cut in half, it can be cut by two-thirds by using AI. That to me is incredibly exciting.\nTB: Some AI boosters argue the technology will soon replace all human labour. Do you think your grandchildren will have to work? \nRH: I hope so. I hope so. What a life if they don’t. \nThis transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity",

        "Content": "Back in the day, I had a mild obsession with Mario Draghi’s ties. At the time, the Italian was president of the European Central Bank and the internet was fun in a way that is hard to imagine now. Very online people, including me but also including supposedly busy bankers and fund managers, spent a decent amount of time on Twitter guessing what colour tie Draghi would wear to his post-rate-announcement press conference and what symbolism it would convey. (Answer: none, but it was good clean fun, and that electric blue tie did seem to come out a lot at key moments.)\nHis successor Christine Lagarde upped the ante big time this week, explaining the ECB’s historic decision to cut interest rates out of step with the US while sporting a necklace that spelt out “in charge”. I am in awe of this styling move and will henceforth pay more attention to her bling.\nHowever, it increasingly feels like the thing to watch is not ECB neckwear but Nvidia, Nvidia and Nvidia.\nThe US-listed chipmaker has assumed a dominant role in global markets over recent months, and this week hit some new milestones. Its market capitalisation briefly vaulted over $3tn, making it larger than Apple and also larger than JPMorgan, Berkshire Hathaway and Meta combined. The company is worth the entire French Cac 40 stocks index plus most of Germany’s Dax. It’s a monster. \nThe famous Magnificent Seven grouping of tech stocks is starting to feel like the Chosen One. Several of the others have made a great start to the year (not you, Tesla), with Meta up 43 per cent, for example, and Alphabet up 27 per cent. (Elon Musk’s electric-vehicle company has lost 28 per cent, which must warrant some kind of demotion.) But Nvidia has gained more than 147 per cent just this year.\nDaily broker research notes are peppered with constant references to this one stock. Whether it’s up, down or sideways, it drags global markets along with it for the ride.\nIn part this is because, pretty much by accident, it has found a cute niche where heads, it wins and tails, it also wins. Want a risky stock to ride the market momentum because hey, you only live once? Nvidia fits the bill. Want a rock-solid haven to hide in if things get tough? May I present Nvidia. How about something in the middle — a high-quality stock churning out enormous revenues? Funny you should mention…\nBig tech stocks, among them Nvidia, “are being rewarded for being some of the most successful companies of all time, with unbelievable cash flows”, says Paul Quinsee, global head of equities at JPMorgan Asset Management. “The profitability is just extraordinary.”\nIt seems implausible that Nvidia can keep on climbing this fast, otherwise by the end of the year the company will be worth more than $6tn and, I mean, come on. That would be reminiscent of the parabolic ascent of Cisco, which ended in tears in the dotcom era.\nBut a counterintuitive bedrock of support is still likely to come not just from the momentum jockeys and punters, but also from professional investors. How many of them will want to take the career risk of missing on Nvidia’s gains given it accounts for more than 6 per cent of the S&P 500 index? And for some investors, the risk to return ratio of some big tech stocks may be better than it seems in a world where haven assets are in short supply. \nFrench asset manager Carmignac touched on this in a presentation this week. Government bonds, it said, simply no longer fit the bill of a safe retreat to balance out a diversified and generally risk-seeking portfolio. The nature of inflation — the mortal enemy of bonds — has shifted from something that is predominantly demand-driven to something stickier. \nReasons for that include nasty geopolitics, and the global need for companies and governments to spend vast sums on defence and on trying to ensure the survival of the planet. Carmignac chief economist Raphaël Gallardo argues this new era is “changing the way we invest”.\n“We have spent most of our careers where . . . the low-risk asset is bonds,” he says. “Now we need to completely review our assessment of risk. Our hedges are the assets traditionally seen as high risk.”\nCarmignac is avoiding long-term government debt, with maturities from 10 to 30 years, which is so sensitive to shifts in inflation and interest rates, leaning, instead, on short-term debt and a “barbell” of exposure to stocks. That means a slice in stocks that do well when inflation picks up, notably in commodities, balanced out by what Gallardo considers lower-risk assets, including tech stocks such as, of course, Nvidia.\nJust like anything in markets, this could all go horribly wrong. Artificial intelligence, the driving force behind demand for Nvidia’s chips, could still overpromise and under-deliver. Tariffs or regulation or some hitherto unforeseen source of competition could bite. Everyone knows this. Until then, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang might want to flash some “in charge” jewels. \nkatie.martin@ft.com\n",
